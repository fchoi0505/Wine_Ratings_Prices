                      Richness of flavor and an especially creamy, melting texture help this wine stand out in a crowd. The wine is 80% barrel fermented and aged on the lees.

                      Wild berry, dark spice, new leather and truffle aromas take center stage along with a whiff of violet. The linear medium-bodied palate is on the racy side, offering cranberry, star anise and crushed herb alongside tight, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2019–2026.

                      There's a dried fennel note that shows on many Temecula Valley wines, but this blend of 48% Grenache, 34% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre uses that spice note to its advantage. Plump red-plum and hickory-smoke aromas touch on that anise-like note on the nose, while the palate shows cherry wood, elegant red-fruit and roasted fennel-bulb flavors.

                      Fine oak helps an otherwise ripe and earthy nose. A rich saturated palate ranks as syrupy, while this Tempranillo-led blend tastes of coconut, chocolate mint and blackberry jam. While thick and stout throughout, this off-vintage wine always seems a bit flat. Drink through 2021.

                      Slightly off-dry in style, this offers heady aromas of waxy lemon, nectarine, flower blossoms and a touch of honey. The residual sugar is subtle, adding more in the way of ripe fruitiness and texture than overt sweetness.                      ",,87,19.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Gris,Lawson's Dry Hills

                      Some funk on the nose blends with aromas of scrambled eggs and arugula.

                      This includes 25% mixed blacks, all old-vine—a study in compost earthiness and baked blueberry.

                      Notes of ripe, green pear are subdued on the nose. They are more impressive on the palate where a little residual sweetness boosts them.

                      This is a gorgeous wine made in minuscule amounts, fermented in both stainless steel and one-third new French oak before aging in neutral French oak.

                      There are already indications of fine maturity in this wine. Yeast and toasty flavors mingle with the crisp acidity and ripe stewed apricots and apple to give richness. It also has the nervy acidity that is typical of Alfred Gratien Champagnes, which will allow the wine to age further.

                      Done in a light tart refreshing style, this mixes strawberry fruit with hints of sliced orange peel. There's a snap to the finish suggesting wet stone.

                      A wonderfully earthy note appears before lemon and crisp apple on the nose. The palate has something unusually savory, like crushed fennel, smoky cured meat and a creamier backdrop. All along, a bright lemon streak acts as a fault line of freshness. This is complex, unusual but utterly fresh. The finish is dry and wonderfully tangy. Drink through 2035.

                      A touch of apricot skin swings in with the ripe juicy pear notes on the nose. The palate scoops this fruity richness up with both a touch of residual sugar and a mellow phenolic earthiness that is reminiscent of almond skin and pear pips. Lemon freshness frames this while some alcoholic heat makes the aromas heady and expressive. This is a big, generous but very balanced and layered wine. Wait for this.

                      This is an awesome expression of cool climate Syrah, with rosemary-crusted lamb chops, peppercorns, asphalt and elderberry-jam aromas starting the show. The palate is intense with cracked pepper, bay leaf, rosemary oil and sage, which play against riper black-fruit tones and elegant lavender flavors.

It's intensely rich, bursting with mulberry and cherry flavors, yet not brawny or dense. Finessed and fine in texture, it's marked by soft, chalky tannins and bright, sunny acidity. The finish is long, offering lingering hints of crushed earth and garrigue. A treat to savor now–2030.

                      This is a sort of ad hoc field blend, composed of estate-grown fruit that didn't find its way into any of the many single varietal blends. Ten different grapes are in the mix, but more than half, unsurprisingly, is Tempranillo. It blends seamlessly, a potpourri of black fruits, cacao and graphite, with a whiff of cigar box. At this price it's worth loading up by the case.                      ",Vintner's Blend #18,90,18.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Red Blends,Abacela

The inherent power of this wine is undeniable, the body is immensely concentrated, dense with fruit but also with the zestiness of lime which counters the sweetness. A pleasantly bitter, almost pithy and salty texture makes the mouth water and tingle. The finish is medium sweet and packs a real punch. Drink 2025–2035.

The aromas provide notes of vanilla, baking spice, fresh herb, cherry, pencil lead, dill and anise, with the oak far out front.

The palate makes this fruity array even more precise and appetizing. All is drawn precisely due to bright citrus freshness—think ripe lemon, tart red apple and tangerine. There is concentration, ripeness and utter freshness and quite a bit of power. The dry finish lets these notions speak all the more clearly. Drink through 2030.

                      A citrus zest headiness on the nose precedes a very concentrated palate where zesty lemon blitzes against the medium sweetness. That citrus zest delineates the juicy pear and peach notes that swirl headily, showing their purity and fullness. This is concentrated, intense, off dry but supremely balanced.

                      A subtle note of reduction still clings to the tender peach notes on the nose. The palate comes in with medium sweetness and paints an alluring picture of peach—of its fleshy, juicy and sweet ripeness, but also of the wonderfully textured bitterness of peach peel. On the finish a bright, lovely streak of ripe lemon zest sets a fresh friendly accent and leaves this with an off-dry moreish finish. Lovely now but it is certain to evolve.

                      Rusty red cherry, wild mint, turned earth and rainbow peppercorns show on the lovely nose of this bottling by Chad Melville from his family's property. The palate is extremely fresh and vibrant, with Bing cherry and plump hibiscus flavors at the core, dazzled by white pepper and olive tapenade on the fringes.

                      While labeled Willamette Valley, this block selection is entirely estate-grown McMinnville AVA fruit. Spicy blackberry jam, cinnamon and chocolate flavors carry this wine, along with a pretty streak of candied violets. It shows medium concentration and high-toned brightness.

                      This blend is nearly a third each of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a deep, dark oak profile and plenty of firm, chalky tannins. The flavors lean toward licorice and cherry, with a bit of coffee and toffee richness.                      ",Proprietory,90,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Corley

                      Made in a Sauternes-like method, this dessert wine is balanced and smooth, its interwoven layers a celebration of salted caramel, green apple and dried apricot.

                      This cloudy, unfiltered pét-nat is made from the Puglian variety Bianco d'Alessano. It changes rapidly in glass, morphing from tropical fruit and floral aromas to apple skins and green herbs. It's pithy and slightly creamy on the palate, balanced by a refreshing zing of acidity and a fruity, herbal punch right to the end. A porch pounder through and through, especially considering it comes in at just 10% abv.

                      Earthy, floral blackberry aromas are spicy and herbal in a way that's familiar to Carmenère. A fleshy palate with tomatoey acidity is strong but not overly tough. Herbal, minty olive and black plum flavors are spicy prior to a rumbling finish.                      ",Marques de Casa Concha,87,25.0,Peumo,,,Carmenère,Concha y Toro

                      There's a pleasing petrol character on the nose of this medium-sweet bottling, along with grapefruit and orange peels and rainy cement.

                      This is a fascinating wine—one of the few white Pinot Noirs from the region. It starts with beeswax, yeast and lemon rinds on the nose, and then hits the palate both broadly and energetically, offering smoked lemon peels, the slightest hint of vanilla and more wax.

                      This is all Dineen Vineyard (Rattlesnake Hills) fruit, aged in a mixture of neutral and twice-filled French oak barrels—a rare look at this variety in the state without overt oak influence. Aromas of pencil eraser, gummy bear, tobacco and spice are followed by plentiful dried and fresh tobacco flavors that show a reserved styling.

                      Abundantly flavorful and full bodied, this wine has lots of dark berry and black-cherry aromas, a big rich mouthfeel and deep layered fruit flavors sprinkled with spices from cinnamon to bay leaf to black pepper. It tastes extra ripe and has the moderate tannins and good acidity to support that ripeness.

                      This is a distinctive and detailed wine that starts with floral and spicy aromas, follows with generous fruit flavors and intriguing accents of tea, rhubarb and wet stone. It's ripe but not overly so, and that little bit of restraint gives it an appealing structured mouthfeel and fine sense of balance.

                      The Henschkes may be better known for Shiraz but their Cabs can be nearly as singular and expressive. Cyril blends small amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot for what is a relatively quiet, gentle wine that seems to glide along to its own beat, completely unaware of its more robust counterparts down the hill in the Barossa Valley. Understated aromas of red currants, graphite, violets, damp earth, and whispers of salt and smoke lead seamlessly into a palate of ultrafine, sinewy tannins, silky texture and an earthy finish. Still in its youth, Cyril should blossom over time.                      ",Cyril Henschke,93,155.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,,Cabernet Blend,Henschke

There is ripe apple with hints of quince. There are ripe lemons galore alongside juicy pear and aromatic stone fruit. The midpalate is concentrated and crisp, despite the slight sweetness. This is a shimmering plaything hovering between sweet accents and killer freshness. Make most of this potential at the table. Lovely now, certain to continue evolving.

                      A lovely scented aspect of crushed citrus foliage flits by the nose before ripe pear notes take over. These also dominate the palate but are tempered by a lovely, pleasantly bitter edge that is reminiscent both of fir honey and citrus pith. Something underneath is fine and almost crystalline. Lemon freshness gives precision to the pear notes and brings the wine to a very balanced, just off-dry finish.

The palate then comes in with gentle ripe and fresh peach, a wonderfully bitter but pleasant edge of walnut and a gentle sweetness that colors the concentrated midpalate in off-dry pleasure. All the zesty lemon ensures lasting freshness on the off-dry finish.                      ",Furstentum Clos des Capucins Grand Cru,94,64.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Weinbach

                      Something creamy and generous appears on the almost-closed nose. A little air wakes up the lime-zest notes which become insistent on the palate and counter spicy notes that have something of maple syrup about them. The finish is dry and lip smacking. This has just begun its evolution. Drink now–2030.                      ",Kitterlé Grand Cru,94,36.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaines Schlumberger

                      This is a structured wine, ripe yet layered with minerality and a full texture. Rich yellow and white stone fruits are cut with steely acidity that shows the wine's aging potential. Coming from arguably the finest of the Grand Cru vineyards, the wine is still young.

This is a powerful, intoxicating wine meshing rich black cherry and berry flavors against a sheen of crushed-stone minerality. It's voluminous but not dense, finishing on chalky, gripping tannins.

Aged in a mixture of American and French oak, it delivers green aromas, suggesting savory herbs, cherry, vanilla, coconut, dill and spice.

Aromas of guava, ripe papaya and plumeria extract lead into a palate that tightens up at first before unleashing the coconut oil, guava juice and white-flower flavors.

                      This follow-up to the winery's excellent 2016 rosé puts more emphasis on bitter herbal flavors as a counterpoint to sweet red fruit. There's detectable residual sugar, and the balance between bitter and sweet components is a little jarring, at least for the moment. Further bottle age may help pull things together.                      ",Pinot Noir,87,13.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Rosé,High Pass

Italy,"
                      Juicy and polished, this offers aromas of sunbaked earth, mature plum, leather and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. On the dense, full-bodied palate, close-grained tannins give structure to dried cherry, raspberry jam, star anise and a dusting of bitter cocoa before a rather drying finish.

US,"
                      Aromas of barrel spice, creamsicle and flower lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors and a warm finish. The oak influence seems a bit overweighted for the fruit in the bottle.                      ",Grand Klasse Reserve Lawrence Vineyards,87,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Viognier,Gård
US,"
                      This medium-bodied wine has plenty of plummy flavors and a spicy streak of black pepper and smoke running through it from the aroma to the finish.

                      Tart blackberry and fresh-picked raspberry mix with an undertow of tanned leather and cedar on the nose. Juicy acidity balances the crushed velvet tannins, housing flavors of ripe blueberry, blackberry and plum that are accented by vanilla, baking spice and balsam.

                      This single-vineyard bottling is very full on the nose with tangy red-cherry, fruit-punch, marjoram and sumac aromas. Lively and tart red fruits show on the sip, which also offers carnation and rosewater flavors that lead into a squeaky finish.                      ",Saveria Vineyard,91,45.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sante Arcangeli
US,"
                      Spicy and herbal, this is a full-bodied, lushly plush wine that holds its power and concentration well in firm polished tannin. Sage, peppercorn and leather ride a lengthy midpalate complementing the bolder aspects of dark chocolate and coffee.

                      Salted apple and white peach aromas meet with a lemony edge, hint of toast and flash of sandalwood on the nose of this bottling. There is strong energy to the sip, where tangy waves of lemon candy meet with warmer flavors of pan-seared apple.                      ",,91,25.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Stephen Ross
US,"
                      Released after the 2014, this wine is herbal, with polished tannins that give it a softness around the edges. Tart cranberry and currant flavors accentuate its heightened acidity and underlying elegance. Still, time in the cellar could do interesting things. Enjoy 2023–2030.

Austria,"
                      The nose of this wine hints at black tulip, black cherry and dusky rose petal. The palate presents a smooth, beautifully fine-grained tannic structure that frames fresh, lovely, tart but ripe cherry notes. A light red with lovely depth of fruit and elegance.                      ",,91,16.0,Burgenland,,,St. Laurent,Strehn
Argentina,"
                      Dark, inky aromas of blackberry, graphite and mocha get things going. This Malbec is full, thick and resiny in feel, with overt oak.

",Ser Mariotto,88,20.0,Tuscany,Chianti,,Red Blends,Tenute di Fraternita
US,"
                      Intensely floral aromas of summer rose gardens and lavender fields leap from the glass, with hints of freshly peeled orange peeking through. The palate is equally playful in flavors of lemon juice and orange-blossom honey, kept light by tangy acidity and jubilant bubbles. White peach joins lemon juice on the finish, with just a touch of nuttiness bringing it to a close.

Austria,"
                      Aromatic green and fresh yellow pear combine to very appetizing effect on the nose. The palate is less overt in fruit but brings bright zesty citrus to the fore. This is refreshing, light, slender and dry.                      ",Stephanus,88,13.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Weixelbaum

                      This blend of 75% Primitivo, 13% Syrah and 12% Cabernet Franc is starting to show its age, offering rustic dried red-cherry, dust and leather flavors. There are hints of clove and cinnamon decorating the candied red fruit of the palate, but it's time to drink up on this bottling.                      ",Moongate,88,38.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blends,Wild Hogge

                      Sweet grass, peony, sweet pea and fynbos aromas lead the nose of this floral white. They're grounded by tones of white peach, Meyer lemon and white melon rind, though the fruity core seems secondary to the abundant herbal tones. Medium acidity lends enough cut to keep the mouthfeel vibrant and the finish fresh. Drink now.                      ",,88,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Le Bonheur

Portugal,"
                      This is pure Arinto whose freshness has been softened and given an extra dimension by the wood aging. It is still a fruity wine with plenty of apple flavors. But the toast and peppery edge give the wine richness and a full texture. Drink the wine now.                      ",Coelheiros,88,20.0,Alentejano,,,Arinto,Herdade dos Coelheiros
Portugal,"
                      Also known as Fernão Pires, the Maria Gomes grape is widely planted in the center and south of Portugal. This interpretation comes from a single vineyard in hills close to the Tagus river valley. It is a delicious soft easy wine with lively apple and ripe green-plum flavors that have an edge of minerality. Drink the wine now.

Portugal,"
                      Part of a limited production range from consultant Luis Duarte, this wine is ripe, gently structured and made to be drunk young.

France,"
                      Something honeyed, something mellow plays on the nose of this lemony Riesling. The palate is bone dry and concentrated, yet there is a creamy richness which lends a sonorous aura to the lemony core. All this stems from fermentation in new wood. The dry finish has a touch of maple syrup and resin. Wonderful and unusual. Drink now through 2035.                      ",Altenberg de Bergheim Addict 1.23 Grand Cru,94,150.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Gustave Lorentz

                      Edgar Torres tapped Zotovich Vineyard for a stunning cool-climate Syrah in this bottling, which starts with aromas of elderberry, tar, charred beef, pepper dust and dark violet. The palate is firmly structured, showing white pepper, black currant and more beef and purple flowers. Drink 2020–2035.                      ",,94,,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Syrah,Hug
France,"
                      Ripe red-cheeked Mirabelle plums and peach fringed with rose petals on the nose promise juicy full-fruited expression. The palate keeps that promise with a flowing, almost creamy and evolving picture of peach, peach skin and wonderful lemon freshness. At six years of age, this wine has only just began its trajectory of development and, while lovely now, will continue maturing. The off-dry finish is long, balanced and zesty.                      ",Grossi Laüe,94,75.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Hugel
France,"
                      Ripe red and yellow apples, juicy apricot and sunny Mirabelles on the nose are all framed by lemon freshness while something floral, almost like jasmine hovers. This same fruit-driven concentration appears on the dry but very textured palate. There almost is something like apple crispness that is mellow at the same time. The lemony brightness keeps everything precise. The finish is dry and lasting and packs a wonderful, almost salty punch. Drink now–2030.                      ",Kaefferkopf Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru,94,53.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Jean-Baptiste Adam
France,"
                      The ethereal lift of dried lemon peel on the nose is followed by lemon-tempered mellowness of ripe pear, ripe peach and golden Mirabelles on the palate. This is honed and lifted, slightly sweet but balanced by the glistening freshness of that pervasive lemon. A field blend of Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this is a wonderful synthesis of sunshine, soil and grape. The finish is off dry and subtle. It is lovely now but sure to evolve.                      ",Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,94,45.0,Alsace,Alsace,,White Blend,Julien Schaal
France,"
                      Ripe but wonderfully tangy notes of orange zest on the nose transmute into a wonderfully high-toned palate of citrus depth. Mandarins and tart oranges create a vision of utterly juicy but always tangy fruit. The palate is dry but it is the tingling freshness, countered by ample fruit, that sets the exciting moreish tone. Drink through 2030.                      ",Pfersichberg Trois Châteaux Grand Cru,94,39.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Kuentz-Bas
US,"
                      High-toned acidity and spice combine with great intrigue in this beautifully quaffable wine, marked by complex texture and bright layers of orange and grapefruit.                      ",Rosé of,93,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,MacRostie
France,"
                      Smoky, flinty reduction still envelopes the nose. Underneath, however, a wine of great purity and freshness stretches its fruity-fresh balance from ripe pear to vivid lemon. The palate is rich but taut, attaining honeyed overtones but remaining chiseled and bone dry. Intriguing now, it's full of promise. Drink now–2028.                      ",Roche Granitique,93,26.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Martin Schaetzel
Italy,"
                      Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, wild berry, blue flower and crushed herb aromas take shape in the glass. Elegant and delicious, the polished palate delivers ripe morello cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and tobacco alongside taut fine-grained tannins. A salty mineral note lingers on the close while bright acidity provides lovely balance. Drink through 2029.                      ",Rosso del Soprano,93,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Red Blends,Palari
Germany,"
                      While subdued on the nose, ripe rich yellow-peach and nectarine flavors burst from the palate of this sun-kissed spätlese. It's a juicy, almost tropical sip, but maintains a racy acidic edge and lingering phenolic finish. Delightful now but likely to improve further well through 2030.                      ",Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Spätlese,93,45.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Reinhold Haart
Germany,"
                      Bracing lime acidity and earthen notes of crushed stone and salt mark this complex spätlese. Bracing white grapefruit and lemon flavors abound on the palate, softened by a honeyed sweetness and hint of caramelized sugar on the finish. This taut racy wine that should improve through 2030, hold further.                      ",Wintricher Ohligsberg Spätlese,93,45.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Reinhold Haart
Germany,"
                      While dry in style, this intensely ripe Riesling offers a deeper concentration of white grapefruit and yellow-plum flavors than the producer's kabinett trocken. It's richer and fuller on the palate while maintaining its zesty lime-tinged acidity and crisp mineral backbone. This lavish but elegant wine finishes on a hint of orange blossom.                      ",Thomas Haag Helden Spätlese Trocken,93,35.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Schloss Lieser
US,"
                      Powerfully structured and brooding in dark fruit, this velvety red (named for the winery's founder) is exotic and savory in nature. A succulent midpalate gives way to highlights of white pepper, cardamom and black tea as the ripeness grips the tongue.                      ",Lynn's Blend,95,85.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
US,"
                      Hugely concentrated and a touch reduced, this is a lovely, generously full-bodied wine, rich as a dark-cherry cobbler in flavor. The barrel oak is pronounced and supportive of the wine's seasonings of black pepper, violet and plum. The ripeness and richness are profound, met by a structure that suggest further cellaring; enjoy best 2025–2030.                      ",,95,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Pahlmeyer
US,"
                      The winery has been working with this same block since 2005, and its experience shows, starting with aromas of rugged thyme, bay leaf, peppercorn and wild cherry. There's an earthy core to the palate, with forest floor, moss, wild mint and thyme flavors, but quite a lot of raspberry fruit as well. Extremely energetic throughout.                      ",Lindsay's,95,65.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Tantara
Italy,"
                      Smoke, crushed stone, underbrush, aromatic herb and wild berry aromas lift out of the glass. Structured, focused and loaded with finesse, the savory palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and a flinty mineral note alongside taut, refined tannins. It's balanced, with bright acidity. It already has a great depth of flavors but will develop even more complexity over the next several years. Drink through 2026.

France,"
                      Always impressive and powerful in its richness, this Grand Cru has produced a full-bodied, rich and generously fruity wine. Wood aging has added some spice as well, giving a fuller, richer character. The wine needs to age and should not be drunk before 2022                      ",Domaine du Pavillon,94,238.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,,Chardonnay,Albert Bichot

                      This rosé, which is from Tempranillo, shows strawberry and red-plum skins on the nose as well as some sharper rose-petal scents.

                      Leather and pine needle scents compete with blackberry fruit in this wine. The mouthfeel is soft and rounded, and the fruit is annotated with dried rosemary highlights.

                      This opens with strawberry and cherry candy scents and flavors. It's front-loaded and fruity, the flavors fresh but fading quickly. Though it spent 14 months in 40% new French oak, the barrel influence is muted.                      ",,87,38.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Keeler

                      After just three years, this wine has developed maturity. Its red cherry fruit and tannins remain but are balanced by the secondary, undergrowth character of mature Pinot Noir. Drink now.                      ",,86,,Lisboa,,,Pinot Noir,Adega Mãe

                      The aromas of apple and pear seem difficult to access at present. Dry medium-bodied flavors follow.

Spain,"
                      Aromas of yeasty citrus, fresh corn and lanolin announce a softer, warmer-climate Albariño than what most fans of the grape are used to. A solid but bland palate lacks lift and snap but isn't flabby. Peachy yeasty flavors are limited through the finish but never problematic.                      ",Saira,86,12.0,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,,Albariño,Raimat

                      Produced from Gamay Noir grown on both sides of the Columbia River, this bursts with scents of apple blossoms and cherries. The deep color and slight bitter-skin flavor suggest that it spent some time macerating prior to fermentation. What it lacks in finesse it makes up for with fruit power.                      ",OR Sparkling,87,35.0,America,,,Rosé,Stedt

                      This is reductive at first, masked by onion and plastic aromas. It does blow off with some with time in glass to reveal peach, pear and floral notes. The palate is less weighty than the nose suggests although there's some viscosity to the texture that's nicely balanced by tingly, citrusy acidity.

                      This stylish wine balances crisp fruit with a mineral texture and well-structured acidity. The wine is still young, with a tight, zesty texture and crispness.

                      The front label picture of Sigmund Freud underscores the punny name for this new entry into the winery's lineup. The wine was treated to 18 months in 30% new French oak. Its generous, fruit-driven flavors of raspberry and cherry come with a streak of cola, while the tannins are lightly dusty and proportionate.

                      Rounded, creamy notes of ripe and mellow apple stream from the glass. The palate is equally mellow and creamy, with an inherent bright freshness and a wonderfully creamy midpalate. Notions of freshly baked shortbread pastry join the apple notes and make for a very balanced, textured and rounded palate, vivid with apple freshness. This is lovely now, but sure to evolve in bottle. The finish is dry and creamy. Drink now through 2025.

                      There is a hint of wet chalk stone on the nose, along with crisp apple and a touch of lemon. The palate then amplifies both the chalky impression and the creamy mellow richness of the apple and the autolysis. This is restrained but very classic, understated but deeply satisfying with its creamy mousse, a hint of stone and the fruit-accentuated backdrop.

This generosity and juiciness is tempered with bright lemon freshness. Underlying this is a fine crystalline stoniness which keeps this on light feet despite the medium sweetness and inherent generosity. Drink through 2028.

                      A touch of wet earth joins lemon zest and green-pear peel on the nose. It is the lemon that gets ever more pronounced in its zestiness on the dry, vivid and concentrated palate.

                      Jim Barry's premium Cab is a good example of the elegance that can be achieved with this grape when its grown in cooler climes. Aromatically, there's a lot going on here: savory soy-sauce notes and smoky ones, too, fuse with green leafy herbs, red currants, violets and pencil lead. It's full bodied but age has been kind to it thus far. The powerful savory tannins and oak characters are still prominent, but crunchy red fruit keeps things bouncy. Harmony seems to have been found.

                      Kay Brothers's top wine, made from over 120-year-old vines on this historic estate, is a dense thicket of ripe bramble berries still on the bush. There's also a strong exotic savory element: soy sauce, raw beef and Chinese 5 spice. Earthy eastern spices carry through to the palate which is supported by chewy, tight-grained tannins. Everything is in place for this to age with grace for many years to come. Drink now with a rare salt-encrusted steak or cellar for the next 20 years.

                      This is a rare style of wine. Made from 100% Pinot Meunier grown in the Marne Valley, it has a ripe, rounded and easily accessible character.

The subtle palate with its superfine fizz colors the fruit notions in shades of tart strawberry and aromatic raspberry against a more sonorous, gently yeasty backdrop. This all seems very fresh and will benefit from some more bottle age. All the potential is there. Creaminess and fruit just need a little more time. Drink 2019–2025.

The medium-bodied palate offers tobacco and red berry flavors ensconced in ultrafine, leathery tannins. There's oak influence, but it is well integrated with the fruit.

                      This wine comes from the small premier cru that was possibly once part of Grand Cru Romanée Saint-Vivant. It certainly has depth and structure as well as rich black fruit.

                      This is a poised, elegant wine, balancing ripe fruits against a perfumed and textured character. It is young, with bright fruits still to the fore.

                      Attractive aromas of mocha, vanilla, wood grain and healthy plum and red-berry fruits come in front of a creamy rich palate that some might say is a touch fat.

                      Pure Malbec has tannins. But when, like here, they are well integrated into the dark fruits and the wood-aging flavors, they almost melt. This wine has ripe berry flavors and great concentration. The rich structure and power indicate that it will age. Drink from 2023.

                      This wine comes in a can. Up-front aromas of lychee, flower and peach are followed by spritzy fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal.

                      The three grape varieties (castas) in this wine are Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Together they make a surprisingly soft wine considering the tannic nature of each grape. The wine retains the perfumes and the rich berry flavors to give a juicy and very fruity wine to drink now.                      ",3 Castas,86,12.0,Tejo,,,Portuguese Red,Fiuza

                      A fresh nose of ripe red cherry, mentholated herbs and dried hay start off this juicy, easy red.

                      The fresh nose offers fruity aromas of pineapple, mango and melon, alongside somewhat soapy notes of honeysuckle. This is firmly medium bodied but feels bright and zippy on the palate, with ripe flavors of oranges and mangoes joined by honey and white pepper. A touch of vanilla and a squeeze of lemon introduce the finish, which lingers on a bitter peanut shell note.                      ",,86,16.0,Colorado,Grand Valley,,Chardonnay,Grande River

                      This neutral French oak-aged blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot is a side project from the folks at Andrew Will. Its aromas draw you into the glass, evoking savory herbs, cherry, tangerine peel, fresh tobacco, green pepper and black olive. The palate brings pure, textured, seamless fruit and savory flavors that sail into the distance.

                      Winemaker: John Loubser. Made from 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, this leads with scents of yellow apple skin, brioche, fresh straw and faint pie crust. The mouthfeel is rich and satisfying, with abundant melon and apple fruit tones as well as more orange oil and toasted brioche hints on the close. Bright acidity and lively carbonation keeps the palate fresh and balanced.                      ",Cape Winemakers Guild Big Dog IV Méthode Cap Classique,91,,Western Cape,,,Champagne Blend,Silverthorn

                      This single-vineyard bottling from one of the winery's prized properties shows black cherry sauce, dill, anise and coffee bean on the nose. The coffee element is quite strong on the palate, where it spices up the dark-red fruits and settles in next to fresh acidity.

                      This is a rather unique and fascinating wine, starting with aromas of pear galette, peach and apple blossom. There is a lemon-peel tension to the medium-bodied palate but also warmer nectarine and apple-syrup flavors, with a cantaloupe touch that goes into the finish.

                      This rich, ripe wine is also balanced.

                      A little stalky and stinky at first sniff, but beneath that lies the fruit: pineapple and peach with white pepper and butter. Medium bodied with a slippery texture and some citrus and cream notes, none of the funk shows on the palate, it's all just bit characterless. In an ocean of Chardonnays, there are better out there even at this affordable price point.                      ",The Y Series Unwooded,86,13.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Chardonnay,Yalumba

                      This wine's cherry candy and rubber aromas lead to a palate that's bouyant and lively but unsettled.

                      This red label cuvée is made exclusively from estate grown fruit. And although its production is higher in 2016, the quality remains consistent. Concentrated black fruit abounds, recalling blackberry, blueberry and black cherry. There's a touch of dark chocolate and café crème, along with fine-grained tannins.

US,"
                      Warm aromas of baked red cherry and caramel grow more complex due to a gravelly minerality and hints of peppercorns on the nose of this bottling by Ian Brand. The palate leads with oregano and pepper, those spices overwhelming the fruit, and the rocky minerality continues, leading into a cocoa-laced finish. It is a lithe and lively style of Cab.                      ",,91,25.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Le P'tit Paysan
US,"
                      Only one barrel of this wine was produced, and it seems to have taken a leathery direction, owing perhaps to its two years of oak aging. That leathery note permeates the black cherry and cassis fruit, which is concentrated enough to withstand that feature. Still, it's a bit over the top, with coffee liqueur, amaro and cured meat flavors and austere, drying tannins.

US,"
                      Though bottled in early 2017, this wine appeared to be in a dumb phase when tasted a year later. Nonetheless, the overall complexity was apparent, with whiffs of mushroom, ground coffee and cherry tobacco introducing a mellow blend of black fruit notes. It's layered and complex behind a translucent screen at the moment, as it fades into flavors of dried leaves and crackers.

                      This wine offers aromas of leather, earth, and berries. The palate is intensely concentrated and jammy, with brambly blackberry and cassis flavors that show a minty herbal side. Roasted, earthy notes rise up on the finish. Drink through 2030.

Australia,"
                      Unfortunately, the first bottle of this was corked, which seems a shame considering the steep price, which has skyrocketed in recent years. The second bottle, however, showed off richness and complexity, with notes of raspberry, cherry, beets, coffee grounds, dark chocolate and a savory earthy Middle Eastern spice element. Chalky in texture with tight dusty tannins and drying herbal woody characters, this Cab is still in its infancy. Leave it be for a few years, however, and it should blossom beautifully.                      ",Bin 707,93,500.0,Australia Other,Australia,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Penfolds

",Monvigliero Riserva,90,90.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Castello di Verduno
US,"
                      Good balance and a plethora of juicy, ripe fruit flavors highlight this full-bodied wine. It has generous black cherry and light baking-spice aromas, plenty of cherry and sour cherry in the flavors and a moderately tannic texture livened by good acidity.                      ",Kite's Rest,94,50.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino County,Pinot Noir,Black Kite
US,"
                      Elegant aromas of black raspberry, wild mint, tarragon and mossy earth show on the nose of this clonal blend. Earthy thyme and cherry-tomato flavors play against the cranberry and raspberry fruit of the palate, with bright acidity driving deep into the finish.                      ",3 Clone Estate,94,58.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Boekenoogen
France,"
                      Under winemaker Nadine Gublin's hand and new ownership, this four-acre former Charles Blondeau-Danne Père property delivers from the start offering both great richness and a tight texture. It is concentrated with mineral texture giving a balanced, rich wine that also has freshness. It sings of attractive fruits and structure as well as immediate drinkability.                      ",La Pièce sous le Bois Premier Cru,94,126.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Château de Saint-Aubin
US,"
                      Dark yet pure aromas of blueberry, black pepper, olive and savory roasted beef show on the nose of this blend of 57% Merlot and 43% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's thick and lavish on the palate, with sticky tannins and dark berry and charred meat flavors that make the mouth stand at attention. Drink 2020–2035.                      ",Micho,94,75.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Daou
France,"
                      This wine has both power and the richness of the vintage. It has the potential to be opulent, full and delicious. Give this ripe wine with dense red fruits time. Drink from 2024                      ",Clos des Chênes Premier Cru,94,90.0,Burgundy,Volnay,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Antonin Guyon
France,"
                      Crisp black plum and blackberry aromas are tinged with violet, spice and crushed mineral on the nose of this vibrant, perfumed wine. It's supple and plump, offering plumes of rich blackberry and plum flavors, but there's a firm mineral backbone as well, along with fine, upright tannins. Lovely already but will improve through 2030.                      ",Les Hauts de Montmirail,94,50.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Brusset
Italy,"
                      Aromas of camphor, dried rose, aromatic herb and a whiff of new leather come together on this fragrant red. Elegantly structured, the focused palate delivers red cherry, cranberry, star anise and rosemary alongside firm refined tannins and vibrant acidity. It's still youthfully austere so give it a few more years to unwind. Drink 2022–2029.                      ",Sarmassa,93,80.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Brezza
Portugal,"
                      This impressive wine has weight and serious intent. Even at four years old, the tannins and the black-coffee flavors are prominent, suggesting this complex wine needs to age further. To balance all this density and concentration, the opulent blackberry fruits power through the rich structure. Drink from 2020.                      ",Grande Reserva,93,40.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,CARM
Canada,"
                      Fermented in large oval casks, this wine is lush in aromas of seashell, flint and peaches. Those flavors combine in a textured, complex midpalate, adding orange, apple and butter cookie along the way. Drink now through the late 2020s.                      ",Attack,93,90.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,,Chardonnay,CheckMate
France,"
                      With the Bandol's very own Mourvèdre dominating the blend of this wine, it has a spicy character, with layers of tannins as well as rich red-currant and berry fruits. It's a complex wine, offering pure fruit but with elegance and a rich aftertaste. Drink from late 2018.                      ",Château Romassan,93,55.0,Provence,Bandol,,Rosé,Domaines Ott
France,"
                      Notions of very ripe aromatic pear stream from the nose with almost insistent headiness. The palate continues in this heady vein with a full boost of sweetness to the rich pear fruit, creating even more opulence. The palate is immensely concentrated, also in freshness, to provide a counterpoint to the decadence of all the honeyed fruit. Everything about this happens at full volume and the finish is long, medium sweet and lasting.                      ",Vorbourg Grand Cru,93,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Dopff & Irion
US,"
                      Savory aromas of white pepper, charred wood and roasted black fruit run alongside elegant touches of purple flowers on the very layered nose of this bottling. It's lightly bodied for Syrah but very energetic on the palate, offering lilac, violet, pepper and elderberry flavors.                      ",,93,82.0,California,Ballard Canyon,Central Coast,Syrah,Folded Hills
Chile,"
                      Earthy, beefy berry aromas are gamy and herbal, with a hint of green. A full palate with grabby tannins is unrefined but energetic, while this Cabernet tastes of herbal berry fruits. A finish with oak, plum and currant flavors shows fresh acidity and scratchiness.                      ",Gran Reserva,87,17.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Koyle
France,"
                      This simple, ripe and fruity wine offers spice as well as rich red-berry flavors. Softly textured and with just enough acidity, it is ready to drink.                      ",Laurent Dufouleur Cuvée Grégoire,87,30.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,,Pinot Noir,L. Tramier & Fils
Chile,"
                      Condensed dark berry aromas run heavy on the spice and low on nuance. This is a shearing, aggressive number with hard tannins. Chocolaty oak and berry fruit flavors are firm, herbal and finish with hard-driving acidity. In general, the 2016 vintage in Chile was difficult for red wines.                      ",Cuvée Alexandre Viñedo Apalta,87,25.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Lapostolle
US,"
                      A cassis aroma blends with star anise and cinnamon, wrapped in tobacco leaf on the nose. The palate is laden in ripe blackberry and cassis, backed by robust tannins and balanced by linear acidity. The finish brings black pepper and tobacco muddled with black cherries and a final leathery note.                      ",1836,87,40.0,Texas,Texas,,Red Blends,Llano Estacado
US,"
                      Refreshing aromas of fresh grapefruit and lemon are tempered by lime pith and wet stone. The palate echoes the nose, showing more bright citrus fruit and river rock tones alongside tangy lime-juice acidity. The finish brings fresh squeezed lemon juice laced with white pepper.                      ",Monte Stella,87,20.0,Texas,Texas,,Sauvignon Blanc,Llano Estacado
Austria,"
                      A touch of reduction still plays about the nose of this fresh, brisk, lemon- and lemon balm-scented Riesling. A lovely dimension of leesy yeast in the background hints at its youth, lending some extra body to the otherwise slender yet utterly refreshing palate.                      ",Ried Böckgärten,91,29.0,Niederösterreich,,,Riesling,Weinrieder
US,"
                      One of the coolest sites sourced by the producer, this vineyard produces tiny berries, and the wine is concentrated and complex as a result. Spicy turned earth and baked strawberry show first, followed by clove, black pepper and anise, the wine textured with plenty of acidity.                      ",Atoosa's Vineyard,91,43.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Syrah,MacLaren
Greece,"
                      Jasmine, orange blossom and citrus scents start this food-friendly white from Santorini. Sea salt, lemon and slate flavors prevail on the palate, feeling crisp and laser-focused. A perfect cohort to grilled fish or chicken.                      ",,91,35.0,Santorini,,,Assyrtiko,Boutari
France,"
                      This is what Anne-Laure Dufour considers to be her best wine: from the best vines and best grapes. Almost mature, certainly luscious, the wine is balanced, crisp and rich with honeyed botrytis. It is richly intense, with spicy, apricot and bitter-orange flavors that go well together. The wine could be drunk now, but will be even better from 2020.                      ",Cuvée Jean,91,45.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Simon
US,"
                      This wine is a blend of fruit from Lawrence, Cold Creek and Canoe Ridge Vineyards. Its aromas are not yet ready to reveal their charms, with custard, lemon zest and flower blossom notes. The palate shows focus,  which carries through the lingering finish.                      ",Ethos Reserve,91,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,Chateau Ste. Michelle
France,"
                      This wine is ripe and offers plenty of dry botrytis to give density and longevity. With 95% Sémillon, the apricot, orange and crisp acidity are coming together well. Full but not cloying, it will be delicious from 2021.                      ",Symphonie de Haut-Peyraguey,91,20.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Clos Haut-Peyraguey
Spain,"
                      Briny apple, hay, mustard and yeasty aromas comprise the nose on this basic Cava. A lemony fruity palate is in balance, while this tastes of apple and nectarine prior to a steady finish with no glaring faults.                      ",Brut,86,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Zeta
US,"
                      Plump black-currant, wood oil and licorice aromas show on the fairly ripe and deep nose of this bottling from northern San Diego County. Tannins rise quickly as does prominent acid on the palate, where black-fruit and darker-spice flavors reign.                      ",Estate,86,44.0,California,Ramona Valley,South Coast,Sangiovese,Castelli Family Vineyards
Portugal,"
                      This is a fat, full-bodied rosé, better drunk with food rather than as an aperitif. Red berries and a ripe character give it a rich finish.                      ",,86,22.0,Lisboa,,,Rosé,Quinta de S. Sebastião
US,"
                      A fairly dark shade of reddish, rusty red pink, this older rosé shows aromas of dark cherry and juniper on the nose. There are lots of earthy tones to the palate, where cranberry is the dominant fruit.                      ",,86,25.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Rosé,Alara
Spain,"
                      This sparkling Albariño holds its own, and given how little sparkling Albariño exists, that's a back-handed compliment. Aromas of apple and smoky flint set up floral flavors of citrus fruits backed by a cured-meat note of Iberico ham. On the finish, this turns green and bitter, with citrus-skin notes taking charge.                      ",Laxas Sensum Albariño,86,48.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Sparkling Blend,As Laxas
Spain,"
                      Crisp white-fruit and green-herb aromas lead to palate that's lean and juicy at first, but which goes flat in short order. Slightly bitter white-fruit flavors finish with lemony notes and some minerality.                      ",Brut,86,15.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Barcino
France,"
                      Produced from organically grown grapes, this blend of five varieties is fruity and crisp, with mineral-driven acidity. Well balanced, it is ready to drink.                      ",L'Accent,88,22.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Clos de l'Ours
Italy,"
                      This wine's subdued aromas of white spring flower and ripe orchard fruit emerge in the glass. Reflecting the nose, the bright palate offers green apple, white peach and citrus notes. It has a clean, juicy finish.

                      Lifted ripe red-cherry notes on the nose carry right through to the palate with their joyful juiciness. This is easy-drinking but brimming with ripe cherry and freshness.                      ",Bodenschatz,88,16.0,Niederösterreich,,,Zweigelt,Dürnberg
US,"
                      This wine opens in a wave of bright fresh flavor that evolves to present more creamy and substantive body and richness. The highlights are dipped in peach, apricot and melon, with a pronounced finish of vanilla and cinnamon.                      ",Kylie's Cuvée Dutton Ranch,88,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate
Italy,"
                      This wine's fragrant blue flower and wild berry aromas align with a whiff of dark spice. Round and juicy, the savory, accessible palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry and baking spice flavors cushioned by supple tannins. Enjoy through 2020.                      ",Cedro,88,20.0,Tuscany,Chianti Rufina,,Red Blends,Fattoria Lavacchio
US,"
                      This varietal wine was aged for 32 months in new American oak. Its vanilla, coconut and cherry aromas lead to a mixture of fruit and sweet barrel flavors, and the latter win out on the finish. The tannins are strong and cinching, and the oak seems too far out front.                      ",,86,40.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Liberty Lake
Spain,"
                      This wine's melony aromas come with a dried cheese note. It's soft in texture, with citrus and nectarine flavors that finish melony and sweet, with low intensity and little focus.                      ",Fulget Cuvée,86,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Maior de Mendoza
US,"
                      It's difficult to imagine a darker inkier color than this full-bodied wine has. The aromas and flavors are not as deep and concentrated as the color suggests. Mild blackberry and blueberry flavors dominate and the texture is moderately tannic.                      ",Gravity,86,55.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blends,Mount Peak
Spain,"
                      This wine's yellow color is offputting. It smells more of haystack, compost and rubber than fruit and tastes like butter and dried apricots. It seems oxidized on the finish.                      ",Electio,86,50.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Xarel-lo,Parés Baltà
US,"
                      Though prinicipally Pinot Noir and Gamay, this simple, quaffing blend includes 5% Chardonnay and a splash of Pinot Gris. It's light and fruity, with citrus and strawberry notes and a hint of cherry candy, making it a go-to pour when something heavier suits neither your mood nor your food.                      ",PTG,86,25.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Red Blends,Patton Valley

                      Made in the southern Vinho Verde region, this is a blend of Arinto, Loureiro and Trajadura. It's off dry and soft, with fine fruitiness and an attractive touch of bright acidity to bring out the refreshing nature of the grapes. Drink now.                      ",Terras do Minho,86,9.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Quinta da Lixa
France,"
                      This tannin-backed wine is firm and structured. A blend from multiple parcels, it is full of fruit cut by acidity and impressive tannins. The 15% Cabernet Franc in the blend brings its own softer perfumed character, leaving a wine that is still young but has a fine future. Drink from 2023.                      ",Madiran Laplace,91,49.0,Southwest France,Madiran,,Tannat-Cabernet Franc,Famille Laplace

                      The 49% Grenache shows strongly on the nose of this bottling, which also includes 32% Mourvèdre and 19% Syrah, with aromas of rose petals, hibiscus, fruit punch and exotic red spices on the nose. The palate is lighter bodied and very quaffable, with flavors of dark hibiscus and red plum. The tannins are a bit firm and need some time to smooth.                      ",Gabilan Mountains,91,44.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,G-S-M,Big Basin
Australia,"
                      This is a fragrant, floral Shiraz, with plummy elements and a savory, dusting polish core. The easy-going palate is juicy and savory—firmly medium-bodied—with soft tannins but enough structure to make it last for several years. Drink now–2025.                      ",,91,30.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Shiraz,Bird in Hand
US,"
                      Made from estate-grown fruit fermented in neutral oak, this is a unique white wine with a pale straw color and remarkable power. Fleshy and loaded with an intriguing mix of apple, pear, chocolate and almond paste flavors, it's a bit like a blend of Viognier and Pinot Gris, with more muscle.                      ",Fleur de Lis White,91,25.0,Oregon,Elkton Oregon,Southern Oregon,Pinot Noir,Brandborg
Portugal,"
                      Organically grown grapes give a pure fruit sense to this ripe wine. Its tannins and firm structure are still developing and softening, so it has good potential, with the richness and black fruits coming together. Drink from 2020.                      ",Herdade de São Miguel Art.Terra Organic,91,22.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas

                      Structured while also fruity, this is a rich blend of classic Douro grapes. Firm tannins and strong mineral texture point to aging potential.

France,"
                      Hints of sweet licorice and spice mark this intensely ripe but stately wine made from predominantly Mourvèdre. Compared with the producer's other Gigondas bottlings, La Plateau has a depth of minerality and distinct freshness of acidity. A potent yet graceful wine edged by fine, persistent tannins. Enjoy now–2030.                      ",Le Plateau,94,55.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine des Bosquets
US,"
                      Hardly a run-of-the-mill wine, this potent liquid exudes tobacco and flint aromas that join with wood smoke, cocoa and blackberry flavors to make it dramatic and spicy. Full body and firm tannins build great structure to pair with indulgent proteins and give it the stuffing to age. Best from 2022.

                      The beautiful Rochioli site is divinely represented here, offering a lush, plush wine with an effusive nose of spicy oak. On the palate, the acidity is firm and focused, adding to a complex layering of texture and well-defined flavors of green apple, grapefruit and lime.                      ",Rochioli Vineyard,94,65.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell
New Zealand,"
                      This single-vineyard wine hums on the nose but sings on the palate. Aromas of roasted, salted nuts, delicate orange and lemon peel seem to float in midair. On the palate, the toasty oak may be in plain view, but it's beautifully balanced by river stone minerality, crystalline acidity and a satiny mouthfeel that never seems to end. Drink now–2025.                      ",Hunting Hill,94,49.0,Kumeu,,,Chardonnay,Kumeu River
Italy,"
                      Elegant and silky, this lovely sparkler opens with aromas of wildflower, crushed herb, orchard fruit and a yeasty hint of bread dough. Made with 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, the vibrant, creamy palate shows red cherry, Gala apple, white peach and tangerine zest alongside bright acidity and an ultrafine perlage. A mineral note lingers on the dry, juicy finish.                      ",Dosaggio Zero Riserva,94,67.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Sparkling Blend,Maso Martis
France,"
                      There's a deeply satisfying interplay of texture in this robust yet elegant wine. Its black plum and berry flavors are concentrated and plump but anchored by brisk acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins. It's rolling and rich yet full of tension and vibe. Drinks well already but could gain complexity through 2026 and hold a few years further.                      ",Romane Machotte,94,30.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Grenache-Syrah,Pierre Amadieu
US,"
                      Tightly packed blackberry, wood-smoke and black-pepper aromas are remarkably vivid in this full-bodied, rich and creamy-textured wine.

US,"
                      This wine has a depth of flavor and length that's rewarding within a richly balanced, focused and tightly textured ring of acidity. There's an imprint of lemon oil that's slightly viscous and completely compelling on the palate.                      ",Heintz Family,93,35.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Von Holt
US,"
                      Most of the fruit for this wine comes from Old Stones Vineyard in The Rocks District, the rest from top sites Forgotten Hills and Olsen. The aromas pop, with smoked meat, green and black olive, mountain blueberry, gun smoke, fresh herb, orange peel, flower and wet stone notes. The palate is soft, smooth and sultry yet balanced with vibrancy and freshness. With its extraordinarily long blue fruit- and charcuterie-laced finish, it's an outrageous value.

                      Gentle, herb-fringed pear appears on the nose. The palate is dry and slender but shimmers with generous, bright rays of juicy pear, toned with lemon freshness. This is earthy Pinot Gris, but with an elegant flair. The finish is dry and refreshing.

                      Faint hints of orange zest on the nose become fuller on the juicy palate. A wonderful apple tartness veers between ripe, juicy fruit and lip-smacking refreshment.

                      This one-time cuvée blends a single barrel from each of the winery's six vineyards. Perhaps more symbolic than anything, it's a good wine but somewhat unfocused. The flavor mix includes red fruits, citrus, a hint of mint and tea leaf tannins.                      ",25th Anniversary,90,52.0,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Pinot Noir,Duck Pond
US,"
                      Aromas of raw wood and stem make this wine seem younger than it is. There's raspberry fruit with ample acidity, but these initial flavors lighten and thin out through the finish, giving an impression that the wine is somewhat dilute. With a lot of breathing time, the wine fleshes out considerably, adding bright cherry fruit to the mix.                      ",Temperance Hill Vineyard,90,58.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Elizabeth Chambers

                      Thick, inky and almost chunky in the glass, this is a powerful wine, starting with aromas of tar, charred meat, oak and blackberry paste. The roasted and charred elements of the palate are balanced by blackberry jam, white pepper and dried herbs, with tarry, sticky tannins coating the entire sip.

US,"
                      Smoke plays a large role in this wine, starting with the oak and hickory aromas that decorate the sour cherry elements of the nose. Baked cherry shows on the sip before the smoky aspects take hold, which are pleasing and would make a great pairing for a barbecue.                      ",Ashley's,90,58.0,California,Sta.

                      The nose is subtle but sends some heady pear-tinged heat. The palate comes in with perceptible sweetness which boosts an array of juicy russet and yellow pear. An earthy phenolic backdrop provides some counter measure to this generous rounded ripeness, while freshness gives precision to this evolving, powerful but balanced wine. The finish is off dry.

                      The merest hint of pink grapefruit adds delicious raciness to the idea of strawberry and cream on the nose. The palate takes these notions and merges them into a seamless vision of toned richness, fuity depth and sonorous joy. All this is underpinned by an electric fault line of freshness—a guiding light that lasts beyond the long, clean and expressive finish.

                      The nose on this single-vineyard expression combines ripe red fruits of pomegranate and raspberry with spicy Red Hots cinnamon candies.

                      Fleshy and full bodied, this wine shows a pronounced toasted-oak character, with swirls of pineapple and caramel contributing additional richness.

                      A full-fruit nose is lightly toasted, with a flicker of menthol and tobacco coming from the combination of ripe berry fruit and oak. A saturated palate is intense but still a bit rough at this young age. Rubbery berry, plum and spice flavors get clipped on the finish by hard drying tannins.

                      A touch of baked Mirabelle skin sends both sweet and bitter notions to the nose. The palate takes up this twin charm of fruit and pithiness and lets them play off each other with just enough pear fruit to keep it juicy. The body is concentrated and has a well of real citrus freshness at the core. The finish is still just about dry and beautifully clean. This is lovely now but will evolve.

The wines show plenty of potential, though young vines cannot fully express all the secrets of the land in which they grow. Light berry flavors and highlights of toast and breakfast tea are in focus. Consulting winemaker Tony Rynders has used one new and one neutral barrel for this limited offering, keeping flavors in balance. Off to a good start, this is a winery to watch.

                      Ripe juicy apple notes have a slight edge of heady kerosene. On the palate, the apple flavors take over with their juicy but tart ripeness that holds a wonderful crunch despite a smidgen of residual sweetness. This is concentrated, zesty and exuberant. The finish again majors on apple and is just about dry. Drink now through 2028.                      ",Altenberg de Bergbieten Grand Cru,93,60.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave du Roi Dagobert

                      This is a powerful wine, rich and dense. Aged for one year in wood, it is a complex blend of 70% Tannat with some Cabernet Sauvignon and Fer Servadou. Its richness with layers of black fruits, acidity and spice from the wood aging are just now coming together and the wine is ready to drink.                      ",Dou Barrinquet,93,38.0,Southwest France,Madiran,,Red Blends,Château de Gayon
France,"
                      Because the Bianco Gentile and Genovese grapes in this blend are not authorized for a Corsica appellation, this wine is a super Vin de France. Produced with natural yeasts in egg-shaped tanks, the wine is rich and warm with a lightly oxidative character that adds complexity.

                      Notes of ripe peach have an edge of Damask rose to them on the nose. The palate comes in with an almost viscous roundness, carrying both sweetness and pleasant phenolic bitterness that sets off some of the richness. This is medium sweet and full-on, brimming with the ripest aromatic fruit. Great now but certain to develop. Drink through 2028.

                      There is a hovering hint of something deeply aromatic, almost of bergamot, that flashes on the nose. The zestiness appears once again on the slender palate where superfine mousse tingles and dances. This is wonderfully refreshing, slender and harmonious, vibrating all the while with its zesty rich perfume, pitched fittingly against its slender palate. This is the way to go.

                      This wine spent 30 months in only 40% new French oak.

                      There's intoxicating power within this lush, concentrated wine full of blackberry and mulberry flavors. But it's a polished, elegant wine, too, edged by fine-grained tannins and hints of earth, bramble and spice.

The finish is dry and lip smacking with fresh lemon. Simply lovely.                      ",Blanc de Blancs,93,30.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Pfister

                      A vanilla lick aligns with the ripe pear notes on the nose. The palate shows the rich, rounded and ripe fruit of juicy pears and a hint of marzipan but also lots of lemony freshness that corrals fruit, oak and all of that juiciness into a concentrated, dry and lingering wine. With the oak notes still fresh this will benefit from time in bottle. Drink 2020–2030.                      ",Steinert Grand Cru,93,29.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann

France,"
                      Earth, dried lemon zest and crushed chamomile flowers send their ethereal notes from the glass.

                      This blueberry-colored wine features black cherry, orange zest and black pepper aromas.

                      Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, green wood, dill, menthol and char, making it a challenge to get at the fruit.

",Brut LD,93,110.0,California,Green Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
France,"
                      The nose is still shy, giving a mere hint of earthy pear but the palate comes alive with juicy fresh ripe,yellow pear. There is a wonderfully poised balance to all of this. There is a fluid medium body and restrained power. All of this gives the impression of understatement since this rounded unobtrusive wine truly delivers with its integral balance and its off-dry finish. Drink until 2028.                      ",Florimont Trois Châteaux Grand Cru,93,45.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Kuentz-Bas
France,"
                      A touch of spicy dark fir honey plays about the apple notes on the nose and also makes its dark amber richness felt on the palate amongst baked apple and dried orange peel. The palate is concentrated and dry but keeps this honeyed charm through to the end where it plays with notions of apple, maple syrup and, not least, tangy citrus. Lovely. Drink now through 2028.                      ",Altenberg de Bergheim Vieilles Vignes Grand Cru,93,48.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Marcel Hugg
France,"
                      Ripe red apple flavors have a really zingy lime note about them. The palate shows some pleasant, pithy bitterness and pure lemon freshness tingles on the taut palate. Notes of ripe crunchy apples shimmer all the way to the long, clean and dry finish.                      ",Kaefferkopf Grand Cru,93,32.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Maurice Schoech & Fils
France,"
                      Made from old vines and aged for over four years on its lees, this wine is rich and spicy, with a ripe, smooth and creamy texture.

France,"
                      This rich, dry wine is opulent, with an intense spice and mineral texture. It offers ripe quince and green-plum flavors cut with tight acidity. Still a young wine, it needs time. Drink from 2020.                      ",,90,27.0,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Laffourcade
US,"
                      Not at all what most would expect from a Pinot Gris, this wine is rosé in color, has plenty of body despite low alcohol and drinks almost like a Pinot Noir. The watermelon aromas and plummy, earthy flavors accompany a generous texture and nip of tannin. Biodynamic grapes were fermented with native yeast and not filtered.                      ",Ramato Filigreen Farm,90,28.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino County,Pinot Gris,Donkey & Goat
Argentina,"
                      Toasty blackberry aromas are linear and secure, but fairly basic for quality Malbec. A plump grabby palate is restrained by rubbery tannins, while this tastes of roasted blackberry with a caramel note.                      ",,90,22.0,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Malbec,Finca Decero
US,"
                      Very cloudy in the glass and exuberant with bubbles, this fun and whimsically labeled bottling from Mission Ranch Vineyard shows crisp apple, poached pear and a slight funkiness on the nose. Ripping acidity frames the wildly effervescent palate, where a steely minerality meets with Asian pear and grapefruit flavors.

                      Walla Walla Valley white wines remain a rarity, but this blend of 40% Marsanne, 40% Viognier and 20% Roussanne makes a strong case for the category. Vibrant peach, apricot, papaya and mango aromas are followed by a pure, balanced palate with a lingering finish. It shows some pleasing subtleties.                      ",White on,90,21.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,Foundry Vineyards

                      This is a ripe style of wine with tropical fruits and nutmeg spiciness from the fourth matriarchal generation at this site with ancient origins. It is a generous wine, named for a daughter, with its toastiness and perfumes from the unusual 50% Sauvignon Gris in the blend. Drink the wine now.

                      This wine is still young and shows its wood aging. That will soften, giving the black currant fruits the chance to shine with their stalky edge and light tannins. Drink the wine from 2019.                      ",,87,12.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Supérieur,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château l'Orangerie
France,"
                      Firm tannins and strong signs of wood aging mark out this young wine from the Despagne family's flagship property. With intense acidity and black currant fruits, it needs to soften and fill out. Give this structured wine until 2021.

                      Very ripe, almost sweet fruit flavors pour forth from this full-bodied wine, accented by baking spices like vanilla and cinnamon. It feels very smooth and soft in texture.                      ",Ancient Vines,87,15.0,California,Contra Costa County,Central Coast,Zinfandel,Cline
US,"
                      Fruity and juicy aromas of ripe blackberry and purple flowers prove lush but with a tang on the nose of this bottling. Candied blackberry, vanilla, sarsaparilla and cigar-box flavors show on the palate.                      ",Reserve,87,40.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,Cabernet Franc,Clos LaChance
Spain,"
                      Simple peach and melon aromas are chunky. Strong acidity cuts through an otherwise plump and melony palate. Short, basic green melon and white pepper flavors lose fruit but not their appeal on the finish.                      ",,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Egeo
US,"
                      This wine has a strong new-oak signature easy to detect in the vanilla and cinnamon aromas and the ginger-spice flavors that layer over good red-cherry notes underneath. It is medium to full bodied and highly stylized.                      ",,86,12.0,California,California,California Other,Pinot Noir,Chime

                      Merlot and Syrah make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of raspberry, plum, blueberry, herb and whiffs of tire rubber are followed by straight down the fairway, quite lightly styled fruit flavors. It's enjoyable but comes off as quite light.                      ",,86,14.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Red Blends,Columbia Winery

France,"
                      Something earthy edges the apple notes on the nose. The palate lacks that fruitiness and speaks of more earthiness. The frothy bubbles, however, provide freshness and glimpses of lemon here or there. The finish is dry and clean.                      ",Brut,86,25.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,,Sparkling Blend,Domaine Zinck

                      This is all Grenache coming from French Creek Vineyard. Extremely pale in color, looking almost more like a white wine than a rosé, the aromas suggest notes of lees, raspberry and spice, with palate bringing more of the same. It doesn't all seem to come together.                      ",Beauty,86,21.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Rosé,Eternal

                      A good 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is blended within this wine, as well as 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Impressive, it offers rich notions of dark chocolate and graham cracker that present as round and richly soft. A bright streak of acidity contrasts well, refreshing the palate under cover of creamy oak.                      ",,93,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Franc,Chappellet

                      This impressive wine is full of black fruits as well as dark tannins. Its structure and density comes from the vineyard that abuts grand cru estates in Saint-Julien.

                      This is a tiny production wine well worth seeking, savory in forest floor, black tea, sage and mushroom, with a soft, round midpalate that presents as equal parts silky and velvety. Exotic and earthy, it has integrated barrel presence and tamed tannins, with a succulent finish of baking spice.

                      Succulent in brambly cherry and berry with an effusive, taut and persistent thread of acidity, this is a lovely, memorable vineyard-designated wine, coastal in its bright embrace of freshness and delicate layering. Additional elements of forest floor and black tea provide a nice contrast to the fruit.                      ",Piedra Libre Vineyards,93,70.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davies
France,"
                      This is a gorgeously perfumed wine, wafting of sandalwood, violet and fleshy black plums. It's pliant and round, chock-full of luscious blueberry and blackberry flavors. Chalky, persistent tannins and a hint of crushed earth persist on the finish. Enjoyable now but should drink well through 2026.                      ",Les Routes,93,60.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine des Bosquets
France,"
                      There's a delicate blue floral note that persists from nose to finish here, accenting fleshy but pure black plum and berry flavors. It's a smoothly polished, decadent wine fringed by supple, baby-soft tannins. Ready to drink now but concentrated enough to improve through 2028.

                      Whiffs of cherry blossom, sour cherry and raspberry introduce this pale-pink rosé.

New Zealand,"
                      There are plenty of bright red fruits and secondary earthy complexities, but at the moment the oak overpowers, cloaking the wine in rather soapy toasty and cedar notes. The palate is elegant and restrained, certainly set up for the long haul, this needs time in the cellar for things to settle. Drink 2020–2026.

                      Pale gold in color, ripe tropical and stone fruits, along with bruised apple and guava, white pepper and a smattering of snow peas can be coaxed from the glass after some swirling. The palate is medium bodied and oily in texture, but there is enough acid—along with lemon and herbal flavors—to keep things bright.

                      This bottling, part of the winery's series dedicated to its labor crew, is a fresh herbally laced take on Cab, with peppercorns, asphalt, smoke and earth decorating the tangy black-plum aromas on the nose. Red cherry and plum start the sip, followed by crushed gravel, more smoke and dried herbs.                      ",Heroe,88,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sculpterra
France,"
                      Almost spicy notes of pear tingle on the fresh, aromatic nose. On the palate the brilliance of the pear is accentuated even more with vivid citrus zestiness. The palate remains dry and fresh, while the concentrated body has drive, energy and enduring, almost bracing freshness and wonderful length.

France,"
                      Golden Mirabelle plums and apricots are evoked on the aromatic nose. The palate reprises these ripe notions with added lemon verve. Concentrated, dry, aromatic and long, the body reveals notions of riper citrus among the stone fruit. The flavors last and last.

US,"
                      A relatively light color leads to spicy aromas, a firm gripping texture and very tasty, complex but restrained flavors including red cherry, cardamom and beef tartare. The wine has great balance due to firm tannins and good acidity, and tastes incredibly fresh and appetizing.

                      Fresh aromas of framboise, hibiscus and rose petals make for a very lively and floral nose on this bottling. The palate is also alive and vibrant with flavors of red-currant sorbet, yet mint and tarragon hold that fruity aspect at bay enough to add intrigue.

                      Aromas of Spanish broom, Mediterranean brush, citrus zest and a subtle whiff of oak slowly take shape. On the palate, bright acidity frames ripe lemon, golden apple, coffee bean and minerality.

                      A touch of Turkish delight flashes across the nose before ripe bottled peach takes over. On the palate, the peach reigns supreme with its juicy, generous and aromatic sweetness. The finish is off dry, a little warm but also tempered with a streaky tinge of tangy lemon freshness that makes you want to sip more.                      ",Furstentum Grand Cru,93,46.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Meyer-Fonné
France,"
                      A gentle hue of russet pear peel on the nose starts to unfold on the palate. The juiciness and the purity of ripe pear flesh become apparent against a background that owes as much to phenolic texture as to concentrated freshness. These elements are well placed to counter the alcoholic warmth. This is rather powerful but also very well balanced with a dry and sustained finish. Lovely now but with the stuffing to evolve. Drink until 2028.                      ",Kaefferkopf Grand Cru,93,54.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Meyer-Fonné

                      An almost perfumed hint of hedgerow fruit precedes the richer notes of ripe apple on the nose. This is followed by lovely yeasty hints of autolysis. On the palate, these notions combine in a most convincing joyful fashion. Every tiny bubble that bursts brings some of that rounded, fruity but ultimately fresh vividness. This comes with serious intent but an even greater proportion of charm.                      ",Classic Cuvée,93,58.0,England,,,Champagne Blend,Nyetimber

                      Elegantly structured, this focused red opens with delicate enticing scents of rose, woodland berry and star anise. The lithe polished palate delivers strawberry compote, red cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside taut smooth tannins. It's balanced, with bright acidity. Drink 2020–2029.

US,"
                      This has underlying smoke and char that works well to bring out the lithe, cool-climate silkiness of texture and tart high-toned fruit. Cranberry, pomegranate and a squeeze of citrus appear on the intriguingly bright, delicate palate as white pepper develops on the finish.

                      An intense elderberry aroma meets with an equally powerful scent of toasted oak on the nose of this blend of 63% Malbec, 23% Petit Verdot and 14% Cabernet Franc. The elderberry-oak combination carries into the palate as well, where it also picks up blackberry jam and pastry flavors, layered with polished tannins and light acidity.

                      Sensuality abounds in this voluptuously ripe, plummy wine full of concentrated black cherry and berry flavors. It's a fleshy, hedonistic wine accented by notes of anise, toast and vanilla. Ripe but persistent tannins frame a long finish. It's ready to drink now but should improve through 2028.                      ",Vin Rare,93,35.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Dauvergne & Ranvier
US,"
                      This is an expertly delivered steak house Pinot Noir, with big, booming aromas and flavors. Concentrated, intense tones of Bing cherry and boysenberry are lifted by star anise and a strong floral character on the nose. The palate brings flavors of boysenberry pie and vanilla, with bright acid and smooth but hearty tannins.

                      Apricot aromas and a generous texture are balanced by the crisp freshness of this ripe wine.

                      Warming notes of cedar and spice mingle into juicy blackberries and plum in this potent, penetrating wine originating from the sun-drenched plateau of Gigondas. A bold proportion of Mourvèdre accentuates its deep, concentrated character, but sunny acidity and a clean mineral backbone lend balance. Approachable already but should improve through 2026 and hold further.                      ",,93,30.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de Piaugier
France,"
                      Grown on the plain below Saint-Émilion, this open, gently fruity wine is young.

                      Baked plum, licorice and lavender aromas and flavors define this jammy wine, which takes on a sweetness of oak. Thick on the midpalate, it has substantial weight from the tannins and powerfully ripe fruit.

                      Toasty, resiny aromas make for a nose that's more oaky than fruity. A round palate with a resiny texture holds oaky white fruit flavors of apple and melon that carry over to the finish. This is in its last stages of health; from here on out this will only lose clarity, structure and flavors.

                      The product of a troubled El Niño vintage, this has more qualifiers in its name than any wine of this quality should have. Despite all the “estate” and “gran reserva” designations, this Cabernet Sauvignon is a wiry, woolly smelling wine that's rough and raw on the nose. Hard-smacking acidity creates a clipped mouthfeel, while this tastes of buttery plum and currant, all propped up by wiry acidity.

                      Cool, herbal aromas of spicy black fruit and tobacco are solid for Carmenère from a tough, rainy year. In the mouth, this shows pumped up acidity and grating tannins.

The palate is a bit thin and minty, surrounding a light cranberry core.

                      This full-bodied wine has assertive smoky oaky aromas and flavors that nearly overwhelm the jammy fruit flavors underneath.

Argentina,"
                      Black-plum and black-currant aromas are a bit shocked. In the mouth, this is tight and tannic. Jammy black-fruit flavors are the definition of generic, while this settles in bumpy fashion.                      ",,85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Argento

                      Sweet is the name and sweet the taste of this soft wine. However, the crisp acidity typical of Vinho Verde gives the wine a lift. A fine aperitif wine, it's ready to drink now.                      ",Casal Garcia Sweet,85,8.0,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Aveleda

                      Thick aromas of earthy truffle and sweet oak spice create a sheen over a quiet dark-berry tone. The palate is extracted and dense, yet shot through with sharp acidity. Despite that, there's a bit more fruit expression on the palate, with flavors of tart dark berries under a dollop of vanilla and clove.

                      This leads with smooth, ripe and pure aromas of honeyed raisin. That richly honeyed note carries onto the palate, which is thick to the point of cloying. Its corn syrup, candied pecan and caramel flavors are rich and confected, even on the finish.                      ",Esnobista Moscatel Pasa,91,30.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.

                      This wine balances ripe fruit flavors with oak spiciness. Aromas of mahogany and cedar start it off, followed by cherry and black currant flavors that are shaded by chocolate and linger on the finish. It boasts an appetizing and moderately tannic texture, with supportive acidity that keeps it fresh and compelling.

                      The fruit for this 100% varietal wine comes from top sites Seven Hills (51%) and Klipsun (46%), with a dash from Scooteney Flats. Its barrel spice, dried herb, cocoa, black currant, pencil lead and dark cherry aromas are locked up at the moment, but the palate is well balanced and full of fruit and crunchy tannins.

                      Dripping with sun-drenched blueberry and plum flavors, La Colline is Bosquets' expression of pure Grenache. It's a fleshy, opulent wine marked by earthen tones of crushed clay and smoked herb and a delightfully clingy texture. Its soft tannins and juicy constitution make it ready to drink now, but it should gain depth well through 2028.

                      While subtle on the nose, fleshy black plum and smoky violet perfume intensifies throughout this silky, full-bodied wine. It's richly composed yet finessed, finishing on fine-grained, firm tannins. Approachable already but should gain complexity though 2030.

His 2016 Chardonnay starts reductively, but those onion-skin aromas blow off, replaced by subtle and integrated aromas of waxy lemon, white pepper and melon rind. The palate is the star in the show, with a taut and focused line of lemony acidity, stony minerality and long lingering salty and citrusy finish. Extremely food friendly but it is also delicious on its own.                      ",,92,32.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Chardonnay,Mac Forbes

                      This is a rare look at the original vines planted by Richard Sanford and Michael Benedict in the 1970s. Aromas of candied strawberry and red currant lead into a dry palate, where cranberry, rose petal, thyme and dried sagebrush arise. The integrated acidity and tannic structure are most compelling, along with the lingering hint of dried flowers.

                      Brawny in generous fruit and tannin, this 100% varietal wine is from a low-yielding vineyard at elevation. Soft layers of black cherry, clove and a welcome helping of dried herb combine effortlessly on the full-bodied palate to offer complexity and concentrated flavor.

                      This elegant, savory sparkler opens with inviting aromas of dried wildflower, mature orchard fruit and a yeasty whiff of bread dough.

                      This wine is a blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Merlot, with the balance Malbec and Petit Verdot. Aromas of mushroom, dried herb, wet gravel, spice and cherry lead to ripe cherry and soy flavors. The palate brings a sense of elegance and appeal.

New Zealand,"
                      This Pinot Noir-based rosé offers ripe notes of almost candied strawberries, raspberries and watermelons, with a strawberry leaf finish.

                      This wine is something of a disappointment for such a prestigious appellation. A red fruit flavor, gentle tannins and spice contrast with a tough, extracted texture that lingers.

US,"
                      This 100% varietal wine hails from Olsen Brothers vineyard in Yakima Valley and Upland vineyard on Snipes Mountain. The aromas leap from the glass, suggesting satsuma orange peel, jasmine, green herb and plum. They lead to plush red and purple fruit flavors, with prominent satsuma peel notes on the finish. It shows delightful purity.                      ",Foundation,91,35.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Malbec,Structure

                      Brawny and full bodied, this earthy wine shows a generosity of forest floor, cardamom and cola, before unveiling integrated layers of bright strawberry and citrus.                      ",Fox Den Vineyard,91,62.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,The Calling
US,"
                      This spent 18 months in French oak and another three years in bottle. Yet despite its age, it looks and drinks quite young, perhaps because it is sealed with a glass cap. There's even a whiff of yeast on the nose, and the tart, fresh fruit includes blood orange, cranberry and raspberry notes. It's firmly tannic and may hold its youthful freshness considerably longer.                      ",Barrel Select,91,80.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Vidon Vineyard
Germany,"
                      Rambling hints of caramel and smoked nut accent zesty wild strawberry and bramble berry in this invigorating light-footed Trollinger. It's a thirst-quenching fruity wine, elevated by hints of dark granite and ripe finely edged tannins. Drink now through 2023.

Germany,"
                      Smoky earthen notes of crushed stone and salt accent crisp pineapple and nectarine notes here. While dry and lean in style, a kiss of residual sugar accentuates its juicy, mouthwatering feel. Bristling lime and tangerine acidity leads a long, lip-smacking finish rimmed with salty minerals.                      ",Saar Schiefer Trocken,91,22.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Willems-Willems
Israel,"
                      Deep garnet to the eye, this wine offers aromas of raspberry, blueberry and smoked meat. Soft and silky tannins provide the setting for flavors of cherry, pomegranate, roasted meat, coffee bean and white chocolate, with a whiff of smoke on the finish.

US,"
                      This is a compelling take on a sometimes simply fruity and lively varietal from risk-taking winemaker Kevin Luther. It's medium bodied, well balanced and has a complexity in the aromas and flavors that is fascinating to taste. It blends tasty cherry and raspberry notes with accents of tamarind, black tea and clove.                      ",Estate,92,40.0,California,Alta Mesa,Central Valley,Barbera,Wise Villa
Germany,"
                      Whiffs of honey and saffron accent boldly concentrated flavors of apricot and grapefruit in this pristine dry Riesling. While medium bodied in style, it's silky and expansive in mouthfeel. Bracing lime acidity lends a nervous tension to the finish. Enjoy now through 2023.                      ",Westhofener Trocken,92,36.0,Rheinhessen,,,Riesling,Wittmann
US,"
                      This bottling comes from what was once Verna's Vineyard, whose new owner employed Drake Whitcraft for this bottling. Quite dark for a Pinot Noir, it shows very concentrated blackberry sorbet, strong mint, cola and vanilla bean aromas on the nose. The palate is lush and thick with boysenberry paste, clove, star anise and vanilla dust flavors.                      ",,92,44.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Shokrian Vineyard
Germany,"
                      Fleshy, almost tropical notes of honeydew and papaya are offset by stony minerals and fresh grapefruit acidity here. An excellent value for such an elegant wine, it's a voluptuously textured yet deftly balanced Riesling. The finish is lean and intently mineral. At peak now through 2022 but should hold further too.                      ",Baden-Baden Dry,92,22.0,Baden,,,Riesling,Nägelsförst
France,"
                      Part of a range of limited-edition Champagnes created for artist André Saraiva, this is a deliciously crisp and dry wine.

France,"
                      Although not labeled as such, this is a Blanc de Blancs. It is a rich while intensely mineral wine, aged for four years after bottling. That gives the wine richness and enhances the texture, producing a well-structured, taut wine that is ready to drink.                      ",Grands Cépages Chardonnay,92,120.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,Baron-Fuenté

",Pinot Noir,90,18.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Rosé,Jax
France,"
                      Partially fermented in wood, this wine dominated by Chardonnay is crisp, taut, tense and very mineral in texture. It is obviously young, emphasizing freshness and tart citrus flavors. However, it will soften to give a rounder and richer wine. Drink from 2020.

Germany,"
                      A touch of honey lends delicate sweetness to crisp white grapefruit in this easy-drinking off-dry wine. It's juicy and fruity but accented by savory notes of earth, dried thyme and lemongrass, too. The finish is moderately long, marked by bitter orange zest and a touch of green herbs.                      ",Johannisberg S Kabinett Feinherb,90,34.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Johannishof

                      This big, robust wine blends spicy oak aromas and flavors with saturated blackberry and blueberry for a concentrated and layered effect.

                      From a site first planted in 1915, this is a tiny production of wine that's well worth seeking out. It speaks to old-vine dusty spice and dried sage, its texture softly beguiling and boldly full-bodied. It offers plenty of vigor and power.

                      Get ready for a different take on Chardonnay in this earthy, layered wine. It has an unusually deep golden color, mature aromas like baked apples and a nutty, honeyed flavor akin to that of a late-harvest dessert wine. The flavors develop nicely with each sip and reveal subtleties of fruit and mineral that linger on the finish.

Spain,"
                      Pumpkin, root beer and creamy berry aromas are frankly a touch less than fresh. This vintage rosé is narrow and wanting, with an oxidized character infiltrating sour plum and cherry flavors. A skins-like feel and mild oxidized flavors control the finish.

                      Rather light in the glass, this bottling shows cherry juice, smoke, caramel and mint on the nose.

The lithe palate shows a bit more ripeness, with juicy peach on the fore that turns more lean and tart on the finish.

                      Bright lemon and crisp green apple immediately appear on the nose. The palate takes up the lemon theme and adds extra zestiness, while also hinting at a richer riper more generous and juicy fruitiness. This is clean cut, dry and utterly refreshing, with a kind of stony precision. Lovely. Drink now through 2028.                      ",Frankstein Grand Cru,93,23.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Ruhlmann

                      Concentrated black-fruit aromas are dark and meaty. A tight, pure, sinewy body is home to lightly salty flavors of plum, blackberry and natural spices. A direct focused finish is what Zuccardi is seeking from Poligonos, a line of cement-made wines with zero oak. This one hails from San Pablo, one of the highest vineyard areas in the Uco Valley.

Made from 98% Grenache with just a splash of Syrah, it's rich and velvety on the palate but has a spicy kick and touch of minerality that lend balance. Finishes long on firm but chalky tannins.

                      Despite the crazy round-based bottle that you can't really put anywhere, Kripta continues to rank as one of Spain's most consistently excellent Cavas. In this vintage, vanilla and yeasty aromas are mature and heady. The palate offers white fruit acidity offset by notes of toasty bread, spiced apple and pear. These tones linger on the supremely smooth finish. Drink now.                      ",Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature 40 Anys,93,100.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata

Happily, plenty of ripe black-plum fruit from the 130-acre organic estate gives the wine potential balance. Drink from 2021.

                      This ripe, spicy wine shows indications of wood aging. At the same time it offers plenty of fruit, bright acidity and forward black-currant flavors. Made from two-thirds Merlot and one-third Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine has good potential. Drink from 2021.

                      From the young vines of this Graves classed-growth property, this wine shares some of the impressive structure and aging potential as the Grand Vin of the estate. It is ripe, juicy with grapefruit and tropical flavors balanced with spice from wood aging. Drink from 2021.

US,"
                      Made in the traditional method, this 100% Pinot Noir is a bright straw color, dry and tangy, with excellent length and precision. The flavors and color don't suggest Pinot Noir but might actually be mistaken for a blanc de blancs, except for a light lick of dark chocolate that trails the finish.

US,"
                      Almost all Pinot Noir, with just 5% Chardonnay, this méthode Champenoise wine was barrel fermented and spent 20 months en tirage. It's a tawny gold and opens with a slightly earthy aroma that evolves into a complex mash-up of toast, butter, coffee grounds and tart fruits. The color and flavors suggest it's in a prime drinking window.                      ",Brut,90,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Sparkling Blend,Lundeen
US,"
                      Aromas of fresh stone fruit and sea breeze waft from the glass in this Chardonnay that see time in 85% second- and third-use French barrels, with the reminder new. It's silken and luscious on the palate, with ripe fruit tones held in check by a current of tangy crushed minerals and delicate vanilla.

                      Made entirely with Aglianico, this savory rosato delivers aromas and flavors of wild raspberry, creamy white peach, Mediterranean brush and a stony mineral note. Tangy acidity gives it a clean, fresh finish.                      ",Lacrimarosa,90,25.0,Southern Italy,Irpinia,,Aglianico,Mastroberardino
US,"
                      Rich aromas of blackberry jam, roasted meats and gravel are very well integrated on the nose of this bottling. The palate deftly balances pepper and charred meats with a strong black-currant core, adding touches of gravel and tobacco leaf toward the finish.                      ",Solstice,90,44.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Malbec,Midnight
Chile,"
                      Cidery apple aromas come with a hint of barrel smoke. A medium-to-full palate offers adequate acidity, while this older-vintage Chardonnay tastes of generic white fruit, bitter oak and honeyed sweetness. A slight sticky finish is less than fresh.                      ",Corralillo,86,20.0,San Antonio,,,Chardonnay,Matetic
New Zealand,"
                      This wine is initially a bit reductive. It veers towards the green spectrum, showing notes of bell pepper, tomato leaf and grapefruit. There's a biting, slightly underripe quality to the acidity and that is ultimately balanced out by a slightly rounded texture. It finishes on a citrusy tang.

New Zealand,"
                      Fruity but not bombastically so, notes of apple, guava and peach lead into a palate that is creamy-textured thanks to some time spent on lees. The palate is back by enough acidity to remain refreshing yet the finish is abrupt.                      ",,86,14.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Monowai

                      This wine balances loads of peach and pineapple tones with a touch of green bell pepper. The palate is a bit disjointed, with the ripe fruit and bright acidity not quite gelling.                      ",Paper Road,86,16.0,Wairarapa,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Paddy Borthwick
Chile,"
                      Slightly oxidized berry and prune aromas include overt oak and a more vague hint of asphalt. A full, chunky, sticky palate delivers a mix of herbal berry flavors and oak-based clove, and that's more or less how this finishes.                      ",1865 Selected Vineyards,86,16.0,Maule Valley,,,Carmenère,San Pedro
France,"
                      Honeyed richness is immediately apparent on the nose. The palate continues in the same rich, golden and almost viscous vein. Musky flavors recall dried fruit such as sultana and dried apricot, but a spike of fresh lemon balances this sweet wine that veers far into dessert territory. It's still developing but will drink well until 2025 at least.                      ",Anne de K Lieu-Dit Vogelgarten,92,23.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Bestheim
Australia,"
                      From one of the founding Margaret River estates, Cape Mentelle's wines tend to be ultrapolished, classy specimens with nary a hair out of place—unsurprising considering they're now owned by luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy. The 2013 Cab exemplifies this finesse while also starting to show how well Margaret River Cab can age. The currant fruit is getting a little raisiny, and there's vegetal leafy tones, charred wood, black licorice, dusting polish and a soy sauce-seaweed salinity. Texturally this is still tightly wound, bordering on austere, with crisp acidity and ultrafine tannins. Drink now–2025.

                      Technically dry yet with enough residual sweetness to round its sharp edges, this is a juicy and delightful wine. Fresh, tangy citrus, peach and melon flavors are all in play—ripe and beautifully melded. The acidity is clean and refreshing, with no chalkiness.

                      Aromas of cherry kirsch and framboise meet with star anise, allspice and a welcoming French toast element on the nose of this bottling from a new producer based in Monterey. The palate is very fresh and spicy, with ginger snaps, tart pomegranate and cranberry flavors, riding an acidity that simmers low and long.

France,"
                      This beautifully pale-pink-colored wine is crisp and dry, very much in the house style. Raspberries and tight acidity are part of a cool, tangy wine that is zesty and mineral textured. This bottling is still young, and will be better from the end of 2018.

                      This wine shows touches of passion fruit, bitter fir honey andripe peach. These elements unite on nose and palate of this luscious, sweet wine. Ripe lemon freshness and citrus oil set a balancing counterpoint that defines the purity of the fruit even more. Lovely now, it will develop further. Drink now–2028.

                      As with all this winery's reds, there's substantial extract here, giving deep color, dense flavors, and chewy tannins. Its blueberry and black cherry fruit is accented by earthy mushroom notes. It makes a strong case for growing Malbec in Southern Oregon, where Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc also shine.

                      No one in Oregon is more dedicated to this grape than Leah Jørgensen, and nowhere does it pay off better than in her entry-level bottling. A baseline of deep, saturated blue fruit carries the taster into a lush mix of coffee, pepper, tobacco and dusty tannins. The depth and concentration put most $25 reds to shame.

                      A muted nose of toasted oak and brioche leads to an expansive and fleshy midpalate of apple and peach in this moderately structured, medium-bodied and balanced wine.

                      In keeping with the style of this domaine, the emphasis here is on fruit rather than the tannins associated with this appellation. This wine comes from a two vineyards and is packed with red-cherry fruit. Its tannins are there but gentle and right at the core of this perfumed wine. It is young and will need plenty of time, so drink from 2022.                      ",Noizons,91,52.0,Burgundy,Pommard,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Berthelemot

Raspberry compote, fresh flower and barrel spice aromas lead to full-bodied, no-holds-barred fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end, backed by lightly grainy tannins.

                      This is a fascinating wine at all turns. The color is not darker than water, and the aromas are extremely juicy with orange blossom, poached pear, bubblegum and gardenia—one of the most aromatic bottlings around. The palate is bone dry with a chalky flavor and backbone, yet hints of bubblegum and plumeria give warmth.

                      Fermented in concrete, this also spent a year in one-quarter new French oak. Some vanilla scents emerge on first sniff, leading into fruit flavors of berry and plum. As the wine breathes open, it adds some refreshing citrus to the base, and with ample time fleshes out into a full-bodied, fine-tuned Pinot.

New Zealand,"
                      From one of New Zealand's celebrated vintages, this Pinot should be showing some age but it still feels pretty youthful. There are notes of rich, ripe cherry, cola, black pepper and a woody, cedary spice. The palate is plush and satiny, and here its age shows a touch with fruit heading more into the dried spectrum than fresh. It finishes a little on the woody side. Overall it's lacking in some of the complexity and balance one would hope for by this stage.                      ",Jane Hunter,86,18.0,Marlborough,,,Pinot Noir,Hunter's

                      This is a new offering from the winery. Almost all varietal with just a splash of Cabernet Franc (3%) coming from Quintessence and Red Willow vineyards, the aromas of toast, spice, cedar, black raspberry and dried herb aren't entirely revealing.

                      This blend of 72% Malbec and 28% Cabernet Sauvignon is black as night. Inky oaky aromas of blackberry, graphite, coffee and wood smoke suggest an old-fashioned Mendoza bruiser. No surprise that this is chunky and jammy on the palate. Ripe black-fruit flavors include notes of toasted oak and licorice in front of a lush, ripe and toasty finish. While an excellent wine, any fault lies in how fleshy, heavy and soft this is. Drink now.                      ",Gran Vu,92,120.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,,Malbec Blend,Salentein

At the moment it lacks grace, though it has interesting flavors of black cherry, chocolate and graphite. Aging in roughly one-quarter new French oak brings up baking spices through the finish.                      ",Confero,89,29.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Aberrant Cellars
Australia,"
                      Made from 55-year-old vines in relatively small quantities, Angove's top wine is a classic South Aussie. It oozes ultraripe fruits that veer into blackberry jam territory at the moment. Behind all that fruit peeks cola, mocha and peppery spice. The palate is equally plush-fruited and rich, with structured tannins that are balanced by a good lick of acidity.                      ",The Medhyk Old Vine,89,100.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Angove

                      This opens with white peach, chamomile and sage hints. The juicy palate doles out yellow peach, apricot and tangerine zest notes alongside bright acidity.

Austria,"
                      Exuberant pear drop dominates the nose. The palate adds lovely zesty lemon notes on a rather slender, light, dry and easy body. The finish reveals some savory yeastiness.                      ",Klassik,88,15.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Nastl
US,"
                      A very rocky expression of the grape, this bottling shows mud, clay and just a hint of dark red fruit on the nose. Dark cherry starts the sip alongside cola spice, but it's the texture and structure that take center stage, with thick tannins and strong grip. A smoky meat character shows on the finish.                      ",Summit Creek,88,20.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Merlot,Opolo
Italy,"
                      This wine's intense honeysuckle, jasmine and ripe green apple aromas leap out of the glass. The green apple note carries over to the palate, along with honeydew melon and citrus. Fresh acidity and a hint of mineral lift the fruity flavors.

Italy,"
                      Delicate aromas reminiscent of toasted oak, tomato vines and yellow wildflowers take shape in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out candied citrus zest, grapefruit, vanilla and pineapple notes set against fresh acidity. A bitter almond note lingers on the close, as does some alcoholic warmth.                      ",Biscondola,88,24.0,Tuscany,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,White Blend,Poderi del Paradiso
US,"
                      This wine has a delicious, appetizing, tart cherry character supported by firm tannins and good acidity, so it's lively on the palate. Touches of baking spices add to the vivid strawberry flavors.                      ",Label Envy,88,20.0,California,North Coast,North Coast,Pinot Noir,Replica
US,"
                      Grapey, rich and ripe, this very fruit-forward but full-bodied wine from one of the Sierra Foothills' best sub-appellations is drenched in black fruit from the aroma through the finish. Hints of dark chocolate and oak spices chime in as the almost thick and lightly tannic texture floods the palate.                      ",Estate Paso Vista Vineyard,90,28.0,California,Fair Play,Sierra Foothills,Petit Verdot,Obscurity

                      This blend from Seven Hills (56%), Octave (24%), Pepper Bridge (14%) and Yellow Jacket Vineyards offers coffee bean, toast, fresh herb, flower, orange peel, blackberry and black cherry aromas followed by well-balanced fruit and barrel flavors that stretch out on the finish. The tannins bring some grip. Best after 2022.                      ",Estate Vineyards,90,,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pepper Bridge
Austria,"
                      A smoky edge of reduction still hangs over this wine, but underneath it, the unmistakeable freshness of bright lemon peeks through. This lemon streak also informs the concentrated, taut palate. The finish is dry, juicy and lemony.                      ",Loiben,90,20.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Pichler-Krutzler
Italy,"
                      Aromas of oak-driven spice, toasted nut and mature exotic fruit take shape in the glass. The aromas glide over to the round full-bodied palate along with baked yellow apple, candied orange zest and dried herb. A hint of coffee lingers on the close.                      ",Klin,90,32.0,Northeastern Italy,Collio,,White Blend,Primosic
Austria,"
                      A faint hint of lemon oil perfumes the nose of this wine. The palate presents tart apple and ripe lemon flavors in a juicy, light-bodied and easy package. It goes down far too easily with its lemony charm and dry finish.                      ",Ried Rameln,90,24.0,Kremstal,,,Riesling,Proidl
US,"
                      A 100% varietal wine given 26 months in new French oak, this is a well-integrated richly concentrated showcase for the appellation. It is impressive in cinnamon, black pepper and jammy black cherry and plum.                      ",RJV,90,90.0,California,Coombsville,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert John
New Zealand,"
                      This unusual blend doesn't clearly showcase any of its three varieties: Pinot Gris, Riesling and Chardonnay. Rather, it is a fruity combo of ripe tropical and citrus fruits. There seems to be a good dose of sulfur as well, which is masking some of the more subtle aromas and flavors. The palate is oily in texture yet nicely balanced by zingy acidity, more plush fruit and a slightly herbal finish.                      ",Paper Road CPR,86,18.0,Wairarapa,,,White Blend,Paddy Borthwick
US,"
                      This has a wealth of cherry cola flavor that brushes up against varietal black currant and cedar. It takes on a lush brawny ripeness that overwhelms and opts for fruit flavor over structure.                      ",LVE,86,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Raymond

                      This Bulgarian Chardonnay has aromas of lemon lime zest and apple blossoms. In the mouth, there are flavors of canned peaches and apricots with a touch of vanilla bean in the soft finish.                      ",,86,12.0,Danube River Plains,,,Chardonnay,Rigid Elm

New Zealand,"
                      A bit more subtle than some of its more bombastic counterparts, this wine shows notes of grapefruit, guava and citrus. It's crisp in feel, but balanced by plenty of ripe fruit flavors on the palate. A zippy grapefruity note rings on the finish.                      ",Maui,86,13.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Tiki

                      Floral and quite cherry-berry in fruity flavor, this wine has mild structure and generous tannin, with a midpalate bursting in earthy oak.                      ",Battaglini Vineyard Ancient Vine,86,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,V. Sattui
US,"
                      Subtle and complex rather than simply fruity, this medium-bodied wine brings aromas of sunbaked earth, cedar and leather along with flavors like sour cherry, beef broth and anise that are compelling to taste. The texture is firm, moderately tannic and provides just enough tension so that the flavors seem to release slowly onto the taste buds.

US,"
                      Moderate fruit flavors, light spices and a firm texture make this medium-bodied wine appetizing and food-friendly. Made from 86% Mourvèdre grapes plus Grenache and Syrah, it's a tenor rather than a baritone and gives a brilliant performance.

                      In recent vintages, this Limarí wine has been flexing its muscles as one of Chile's best Syrahs. It's big on the nose, which is loaded with cassis, blackberry, spice and leather notes. The palate is full bodied and saturated with lively berry and oak flavors that persist on the finish, keeping the energy level high. Drink now–2022.

                      Ripe luscious grapefruit and gooseberry flavors pulsate from the core of this dry medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. While pristinely fruity, it's a nuanced wine marked by invigorating hits of lime, bell pepper and crushed stone. The finish is lean and revitalizing. Drink now through 2022.

                      This blend of 60% Cabernet Franc from The Rocks and 40% Merlot from Canoe Ridge Vineyard enchants with its complex medley of fresh ground herb, sliced green pepper, moist earth, mineral and cherry aromas. There's dazzling texture and purity to its graceful fruit and savory flavors that carry deep into the finish. Delicious stuff.

US,"
                      This wine is half Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Well-delineated notes of dried herb, raspberry, black cherry, dried flower, graphite and anise mark the nose. The palate bursts with fresh fruit and earth flavors that are at once textured, pure, polished and light on their feet. A long, fruit-filled finish caps it off. It's a gorgeous, nuanced wine that way over-delivers for the price.                      ",Interlude,92,28.0,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Waters
France,"
                      Ripe but restrained black-plum and mulberry notes are accented by a whiff of violet perfume in this wine. It's full bodied and juicy, with enticing hints of mushroom and forest floor that lend complexity to the midpalate. The finish is elegant, velvety and firm. It should improve now through 2025.                      ",Vieux Terron,92,45.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Alain Jaume et Fils

                      Relatively light in color, this reserve bottling from Delfina's Vineyard offers tangy red plum, sagebrush, bay leaf and rust aromas on the nose. The palate is awash in herbs, from thyme to oregano, set against a red-currant-reduction sauce and light savory flavors of roasted pork.                      ",The Reserve,92,65.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Blair
Spain,"
                      Ripe berry aromas are at the precipice of jammy. A saturated palate is not overly deep, so this Garnacha-Graciano exhibits mostly a surface-level character. Blackberry flavors are chocolaty and toasty prior to a drumming finish. For a wine with significant Graciano, a grape prone to showing nothing but high acidity, this is a success and a cool find. Drink from 2019–2035.                      ",Selección Especial,92,125.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Garnacha-Graciano,Burgo Viejo

It's thick on the palate with Indian and Mexican spices (from coriander to curry), with hints of powdered cocoa and tobacco as well. The acid and structure remain solid.

US,"
                      This Syrah-dominate blend smells rooty and medicinal, like licorice and black cherry syrup, sprinkled with white pepper. The palate starts off with a bright berry flavor but quickly softens into baked raspberry, vanilla, licorice and woody tannins. Oak kicks off the finish, while the tannins lend a crushed velvet texture, ending on a dry, muddled black plum note.                      ",Élevé,85,24.0,Colorado,Grand Valley,,Red Blends,Snowy Peaks

                      A rather round nose offers heady aromas of honey, dried apricot and hazelnut.

",,85,25.0,Colorado,Colorado,,Sauvignon Blanc,Sutcliffe
Argentina,"
                      Earthy berry aromas are a bit damp and inexact. A tough rubbery palate is slightly collapsed, while this tastes of salty plum and raspberry.

                      Produced mainly from Touriga Nacional and the local Castelão grape, this is a soft, red-berry-flavored wine. With an attractive touch of acidity to give it a lift, it is ready to drink.                      ",Periquita,85,10.0,Península de Setúbal,,,Rosé,José Maria da Fonseca

                      This is a bold, ripe and rich wine that leads with saturated aromas of black fruits. On the palate, it feels broad, gentle and velvety as fine-grained tannins support flavors of blueberry, cocoa and black pepper. Excellent to drink now, it has the requisite tannins, acidity and depth for aging. Best after 2023.

                      A simple weeknight wine that ticks the New World red box with notes of ripe berries, cocoa powder and slightly sweet, sweaty oak.

                      Not long out of the barrel, this bright young wine is loaded with tasty raspberry fruit. Those flavors are both deep and lively, amped up with plenty of acidity and rounded with a lick of chocolate from oak-aging. Though already quite tasty and showing a lot of youthful energy, the overall structure suggests it will reward cellaring. Tuck a few bottles away and drink now–2030.

                      This well-made wine is crisp and structured, layered in Meyer lemon, mandarin orange and a steely core of effusive acidity. Light bodied, it shows depth and texture enough to match a meal and find companionship at the table.                      ",Estate Paradiso de Maria,92,36.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Benziger
Australia,"
                      Made in tiny quantities, this Shiraz encompasses much more than the typical ripe fruit and oak combo. There's fruit, to be sure, in the form of greengage plums, plus dried rose petals, raw meat and hoisin sauce, with some Middle Eastern spices and a little earthy funk for good measure. It's medium bodied with a briny spine and grainy tannins—elegance and power combined. Drink now–2028.                      ",Omensetter,92,100.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Shiraz,Brash Higgins
US,"
                      This outstanding single vineyard selection pulls out all the stops. Though still young and somewhat stiff, it already shows superior balance and complexity, capturing the tensile strengths of the vintage. Its ripe and polished layers of berry- and cherry-inflected fruit—the result of 30% whole cluster fermentation—are accented with streaks of mocha and caramel from aging 12 months in 30% new French oak. Give it a little more bottle age and drink 2020–2030.                      ",Shea,92,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Broadley
France,"
                      Ripe winter apple and bruised apple peel on the nose suggest mellowness. The palate follows suit with gentle, residual sweetness that accentuates the ripe richness, while fresh lemon brightness ensures it stays on the off-dry side. This wine is harmonious, rich, textured and long.                      ",Collection Terroirs,92,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Cave de Turckheim
US,"
                      One of the meatier, spicier rosés from California, this wine smells like fresh berries and prosciutto, and tastes quite substantial. Made from Sangiovese grapes, it has more concentration than most and keeps improving in the glass.                      ",Dry,88,14.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Rosé,Victor Vineyards

                      This wine's pear, bread crust and citrus rind aromas slowly appear in the glass and follow through to the round, full-bodied palate, along with a hint of marzipan. Evident warmth from alcohol on the finish pushes it to the limit of freshness and balance.

                      A touch of banana, loads of ripe pear and red-cheeked apple, some lemony zing: this field blend makes most of its varietal mix.

                      A very faint but pure note of ripe lemon plays on the nose of this wine. The palate still has some slight fizz from the ferment but displays the same lovely lemon note and adds green apple. It's light, dry, fresh and subtle, with a zingy, long and clean finish.                      ",,90,,Südsteiermark,,,Weissburgunder,Tement

                      Made entirely with Nerello Cappuccio, this opens with aromas of wild red berry, Mediterranean scrub, grilled herb and a whiff of dark baking spice. It's elegant and savory, delivering flavors of raspberry compote, juicy Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside polished tannins. It closes on a smoky mineral note.

                      A bullish nose is charred, minty and delivers heavy blackberry aromas. This is a massive Malbec with weight issues: It's rather flabby, but with biting tannins. Stewed blackberry and chocolate flavors finish with notes of fig and raisin.                      ",Single Vineyard Las Compuertas,90,59.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Terrazas de Los Andes

                      Fragrant spring flower, green apple and citrus aromas lead the nose on this bright, fragrant Pinot Bianco. Reflecting the nose, the savory palate doles out creamy pear, juicy lemon and a hint of white almond. It has a clean, refreshing finish.

                      A touch of earthy banana plays amid the lively mandarin and apple fruit on the nose of this wine. Mandarin notes pervade the palate, making for a wonderfully concentrated, fruit-filled core of joyful freshness. Lovely, unusual and totally refreshing.

US,"
                      This is a beautifully balanced wine that has enticing, expressive black-cherry and sweet oak aromas, and equally vibrant and complex fruit flavors that are well supported by good acidity and moderate tannins. It's a nicely tight wine that doesn't give everything away at first whiff, but keeps one coming back for more.

                      The aromas are brooding out of the gate, with notes of earthy funk, freshly ground black pepper, black olive, smoked meat and tar. The palate is elegant but still richly flavorful with a lingering smoky meat-filled finish. It seems a bit difficult to access at present, though it broadens with some time open.

                      Very aromatic notes of green-apple peel have a richer hint of green citrus and melon about them on the nose. The palate continues with this purity and generosity of fruit, caressing it with wonderfully fine bubbles that fizz away with freshness and poise. This is fruit-driven, totally expressive and elegant. The finish is clean, long with yeast and satisfyingly dry.

                      Aromas of berry fruits, creamy oak and bland spices fit the norm for basic Cabernet. A racy pulling palate is strapped with elastic tannins, while this tastes of savory plum and saucy berry fruits. A steady finish is hard and grating.

                      This wine is a blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Aromas of blueberry, herb, vanilla and toasty spices lead to very lightly styled cherry and vanilla flavors. The flavors seem a bit washed out, with the oak way out front.

                      Pinched, slightly astringent aromas are generic and barely fruity, but not off. A plump palate deals the minimum in bracing acidity, while light generic flavors of red fruits finish watery.                      ",,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosado,El Coto

                      Soft aromas of cantaloupe, strawberry hull and orange pith define the bouquet of this fresh and easy rosé.

                      This wine is still young and firm with concentrated tannins as well as perfumed berry flavors. Its texture and dry core show the ripe fruits and the touches of wood aging that come through gently. The wine will be ready to drink from 2023.

France,"
                      This wine has a bitter edge from extraction but it feels as though, with the weight of the fruit, it will soften and broaden as it matures. Plenty of bright cherry flavors should help it on its way. Drink from 2023.

Australia,"
                      This wine doesn't succeed as well as some of Sidewood's others. The oak influence is sweet and on the sweaty side, and it's sitting rather clunkily beside ripe peach, pineapple, apple and lime notes. The palate sees plenty of tangy fruit and a decent lick of acidity, but it's not quite enough to lift some of the textural flabbiness. The oak rears its head again on the finish.                      ",,85,18.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Pinot Gris,Sidewood

                      This shows varietally correct aromas of apple and light citrus fruit. With just moderate acidity, the palate is starting to flatline. Besides pyrazine-based flavors and oak notes, it doesn't have much else to offer.                      ",Special Reserve,85,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Chardonnay,Siegel
Australia,"
                      There's a chemical note on the nose, along with dusting polish, chocolate and cola, all coming from the oak influence. Plush, sun-puckered raspberry and red-cherry fruits are also in abundance. The palate is rich and luscious with dusty drying tannins and more ripe fruit. The oak here is equally prominent and a little clunky on the finish.                      ",,85,25.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Three Bridges

France,"
                      This is a sharp wine, tight with intense acidity that is not balanced by the fruitiness. Its edge is taut, nervy and over-crisp. It should soften a little and will taste riper from late 2018.                      ",,85,10.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Rosé,,Rosé,Château des Mille Anges

There's also a slightly charred wood character amidst supple black cherries. The palate comes with peppery spice, leathery, taut tannins and an earthy spine. There's an oaky touch at the end, but overall this is a solid wine.                      ",Secrets,89,15.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Red Blends,Killibinbin

                      Smoke, flint, pear peel and earth on the nose promise an intriguing wine. The palate keeps step with rich, almost honeyed pear fruit on the off-dry palate.

                      A touch of reduction still plays on the nose but the palate shows ample, ripe pear notes on a dry but concentrated body. The bold fruit holds its own against lemon brightness.

                      A nose built almost entirely around raw oak is warm and earthy more than fresh and fruity. In the mouth, this is severely tannic and resiny.

                      Produced from foot treading in open lagars, this is a beautiful wine. Its richness is mitigated by its structure and the dense texture of black fruits along with the edge of the spirits and wood.

                      This is a delicious and beautifully-proportioned wine that delivers exceptional value.

Its toast, cardamom, peach and clarified butter aromas are followed by full-bodied, creamy stone fruit flavors with plentiful spice accents.

                      Concord grape, boysenberry and dried anise aromas show on the nose of this fresh bottling.

France,"
                      Stalky and packed with black-currant and berry fruits, this wine is intense with tannins, acidity and a licorice flavor. All this will soften to give a rich wine, although likely the stalky fruit will likely remain. Drink from 2020.

                      Once again this budget label from Paul O'Brien offers exceptional value. Barrel aged for a year in 25% new French oak, it includes 20% Willamette Valley grapes, with the rest from the Umpqua Valley. A portion of whole clusters were included, and the fermentation was done in both concrete and French oak foudres. Some flavors of earth and stem come through, and a certain astringency from the concrete, along with brambly black cherry fruit and chewy tannins.

                      This inaugural release is a blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc and 17% Merlot, with the fruit coming from Seven Hills, Summit View and Waliser vineyards. Seeing just 35% new French oak, the emphasis is squarely on the fruit. Aromas of raspberry jam, blueberry compote, black currant and spice give way to fruit flavors that show elegance, delicacy and length. It's a pretty take on these varieties and the valley.                      ",Chrysologue,89,65.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Oregon Other,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pambrun

                      Subdued, slightly reduced aromas of lime leaf and white peach lead to just off-dry drinking, lighter-styled fruit flavors, with ale notes on the tart finish. There are good things going on, but it seems a bit pulled back for the variety. Perhaps it just needs some additional time in bottle?

                      The schist and granite soil of this vineyard yields a wine that is strongly mineral. Its acidity and fruitiness are restrained by a tense texture and steely character.

                      An elegant and supple example of the varietal, this wine blends ripe, seductive fruit aromas and flavors with a sleek texture and silky mouthfeel.

                      Plush and fruity, this sports a tasty mix of apple, pear, apricot and peach flavors, along with a hint of tropical fruit. It's soft and accessible, with a little extra texture due, perhaps, to indigenous yeast fermentation.

                      Fully toasted oak aromas are smoky and grainy, and they cover up briny apple notes. A mix of oily weight and sharp acidity defines the palate, while this tastes a bit sour, with lots of oak attached to stone fruit flavors. Hailing from southerly Malleco, this is a cool-climate Chardonnay, and thus the high acid level makes sense.                      ",Tectonia,86,24.0,Malleco,,,Chardonnay,Bodega Volcanes de Chile

France,"
                      A touch of beeswax on the nose leads onto a rather sweet palate where a pithy citrus bitterness and freshness set pleasant accents in the smooth, ripe, rounded and generous fruit. That beeswax notion resurfaces on the long medium-sweet finish.                      ",Eichberg Grand Cru,92,36.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Charles Baur
France,"
                      Gentle apricot mellowness joins the juicy pear notes on the nose. The palate adds both a boost of slight residual sweetness and a guiding pithy phenolic element. Zesty freshness of ripe citrus plays in the background. This balanced, harmonious wine has a medium-sweet finish.                      ",Frankstein Grand Cru,92,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Mersiol
France,"
                      Ripe baked and dried pear-notes appear all at once with a deeply fruity allure. The palate boosts these rounded and already sweet notes with even richer honeyed sweetness. The concentration is evident while a chalky backdrop alongside lemon freshness provides some balance to this rich and generously fruited wine. The finish is medium sweet.

France,"
                      Very ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum almost have a citrus edge of marmalade to them on the nose. The medium-sweet palate boosts these fruit notions to the max, tempering them with that orange zest sweetness. This is full-on, concentrated and has quite a bit of warmth on its sweet and intense finish.                      ",Zinnkoepfle Grand Cru,92,29.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann
France,"
                      Very ripe pear notes on the nose have the added charm of ripe Mirabelle plums and a tinge of earthiness. Both these themes are reprised on the palate. Pear and Mirabelle fruit are boosted by gentle sweetness, while the earthiness turns into a pleasantly bitter phenolic streak that is a counterpoint to the fruit. The finish is off dry but fresh.                      ",Osterberg Grand Cru,92,43.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Sipp-Mack
Germany,"
                      Concentrated flavors of white grapefruit and yellow apple are accented by hints of crushed mineral and lime pith here.

                      This broad, rich and mouth-coating wine starts with effusive spicy oak aromas like wood smoke, cardamom and cedar before spilling very ripe, almost jammy, boysenberry flavors on the palate. It's unabashedly oaky, but has so many ripe generous fruit flavors that they balance each other out.

France,"
                      A touch of flint, tangerine peel, red and green apple meet on the nose. The palate is fresh but approachably softened by rounded ripeness. Citrus freshness plays charmingly in the background, but is ripe rather than bracing, making for a dry and refreshing finish.                      ",Collection heritage Grand Cru Kirchberg de Barr,92,60.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Andre Lorentz
US,"
                      Part of the winery's reserve tier, this was barrel-fermented, offering a totally different set of flavors from the stainless steel-fermented Viognier.

France,"
                      Wet earth, jasmine and honeysuckle on the nose carry though onto the palate. Here they are met with apple sweet-sourness that creates balance and turns this into a very appetizing proposition. The body is light but dense with flavor, the off-dry finish is long and moreish.                      ",Midelberg,92,50.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Boeckel

                      Jammy berry aromas are forward but inexact. A tight powerful palate is narrow in scope, with peppery red-berry flavors propelled by lively acidity.

In 2015 the finished wine pushes hard against 15% alcohol, and it's fully ripened and then some, with deep plum and black cherry fruits at the core. The tannins bring black tea, smoke and tobacco notes, with a strongly astringent aftertaste.                      ",,89,29.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Garnacha,Abacela

                      Cocoa, cinnamon and oak aromas are more prominent than fruit on this ripe, full-bodied Pinot Noir. A hard-driving palate is not about elegance, acidity and restraint. Flavors of black cherry, mocha and chocolate are tasty but atypical of most Pinot Noirs. A peppery finish with heavy oak spice seals the deal on this uniquely Rolland-style wine.

                      Candied lemon-zest notions are heady on the nose. There are some earthy hints, too. On the palate, the lemon notes are toned down and appear as fluid, concentrated lemon oil impressions with inflections of ripe peach and pear.

Even the ripe fruit can't quite take away the shocking acidity and intensity, making it best for those who like their Champagne to be seriously dry and tight.

The liberal use of American and French oak, however, does mask the character of those old vines somewhat. It's dense and chocolatey, with plum, black pepper, vanilla and a dusting polish note throughout.

This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot tastes of blackberry and cassis, with a touch of chocolate. A steady finish brings nothing new to a settled panorama.

                      This is a beautifully balanced, medium-bodied wine that goes beyond the basic black-fruit flavors and adds hints of dried earth and bay leaf on the nose and light wood smoke and black pepper flavors.

                      This pretty, affordable Oregon Pinot Noir brings purple fruit character and plenty of appeal. Soft on entry, it loosens up on the palate to deliver a blast of blueberry jam and French oak flavors (though its oak aging is unspecified), finishing with a chocolate note recalling a Hershey's kiss.

An unusual streak of pine sap enlivens the aromas, not harsh, but definitely present on the palate. There's blueberry and fig fruit as well, and the fig comes with a Newtonian crunch.

                      While not from the producer's oldest vines, this bottling is comprised mostly of fruit from 40-year-old Grenache planted on the lower terraces of Gigondas. Its black fruit flavors are plump and round, smoothed over by yielding acidity and a luscious, mouthclinging texture. Fine, grippy tannins lend structure to the finish. An approachable but deeply satisfying wine for now–2026.                      ",Vieilles Vignes,92,30.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,,Grenache-Mourvèdre,Domaine Saint Damien

                      Aromas of orange blossom and mandarin pith show on the somewhat flat nose of this bottling. There's a burst of acid on the tip of the sip, but it quickly fades into dried apple and orange-rind flavors.

                      A strange aroma of multi-grain bread and caraway rides underneath vanilla, black cherry and anise. The palate is stuck on ripe raspberry and cherry flavors, with touches of vanilla and sweet spice and pummeling tannins that lack structure. There is a sour candy tang on the finish, with mildly grippy, sandy tannins and a sprinkle of pepper spice on the end.

Australia,"
                      This wine is super aromatic but in a synthetic way: an unusual combo of lemon, lychee, cardamom and cookie-dough aromas are followed by a rather clunky palate. There's plenty of fruit here as well, but again, it feels rather forced and fake.                      ",Drover's Hut Single Vineyard,84,17.0,New South Wales,Riverina,,Chardonnay,Nugan Family Estates

                      This leads with vegetal aromas recalling celery and lime. The palate is standard, with citrusy acidity and pyrazinic flavors of green bell pepper and peppercorn. Those flavors echo on the finish, losing intensity rather quickly.                      ",Special Reserve,84,16.0,Leyda Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Siegel

                      This blend of Grenache and Syrah tastes like raspberry purée, with a broad streak of vanilla.

                      This wine's aromas and flavors are outright raisiny. Prune, fig and other overripe flavors feature prominently. And yet, it still has some quality and character despite being out of balance.                      ",80 Years Old Vines,84,24.0,Levante,Valencia,,Red Blends,Torre Oria

Australia,"
                      Made from Pinot Gris fermented for weeks on its skins, this is an unusual rosé—and not just because it's technically not a rosé at all, but an orange wine. Unlike most pink sippers that are made to be knocked back, this is a thinking woman's wine. The nose is a heady blend of ripe watermelon, peach, pressed red flowers and shitake mushrooms. The palate is all at once creamy, tangy and salty, with flavors of watermelon rind, ginger candy and cocktail bitters. Geek out with your wine-loving friends on this quirky little beauty.                      ",Gris Fermented on Skins,90,22.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Rosé,Airlie Bank

                      Crisp and juicy aromas of squeezed Meyer lemon, white peach, honeydew rind and rainy sidewalk show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. There is great grip to the palate as well as a light texture, but the flavors are generous with more stone fruit and melon, making it rounded and likable for many tastes.                      ",Kristy Vineyard,90,24.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Albariño,La Marea

                      Extra richness and depth lift this wine to a high level of quality and deliciousness.

                      Early aromas of tire rubber and compost give way to cheese and white fruit scents. A foamy palate quickly flattens out, while this tastes of yeast and tangy apple.

                      Rustic berry aromas are herbal and gritty. In the mouth, this is lively, with just enough body to support high acidity. Oaky, roasted berry and plum flavors show a hint of chocolate on an herbal finish with tomato notes.                      ",Gran Reserva,86,17.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,TerraNoble
Chile,"
                      Resiny oak aromas induce a note of popcorn, while spiced pumpkin scents are savory but not all that fresh. Following the nose, this lacks spine and weighs in as chunky. Woody spiced-apple flavors fade out on a round, oaky finish.                      ",Gran Reserva Origen,86,17.0,San Antonio,,,Chardonnay,Viña Chocalan
Spain,"
                      Shy aromas of peach and dust are reserved. A cidery palate has just enough acidity to avoid flatness, but this is not exactly bursting with tension and energy.

                      This is a new offering from the producer, sourced from a cool windy site in the Petaluma Gap. A whiff of violet rides atop dense concentrated blackberry and dried herb.

It tightens up on the palate thanks to firm tannins, and delivers flavors of black cherry, milk chocolate and toast. Acidity rises into the finish.

                      This tense, dense wine is still young. Its pure line in acidity is emphasized by the concentration and strong minerality. Drink this wine from 2019.                      ",Silice,89,25.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,,Sauvignon Blanc,Francis Blanchet

                      Notes of wet slate, green apple and orange blossom perfume this delicately off-dry wine. The palate is juicy, offering a pristine citrus flavor that is accented by zesty acidity and a clean, mineral finish. While not a deeply concentrated wine, it is invigorating and thirst quenching.                      ",Schiefer Feinherb,89,17.0,Mosel,,,Riesling,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium
France,"
                      This blend holds Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, the latter aged briefly in wood. The result is a generous wine, the acidity integrated into ripe apple flavors. It is fruity, still a young bottling and likely to benefit from a few more months of aging. Drink from 2019.

US,"
                      This half-stainless- and half-neutral-oak-fermented wine takes a gentle approach to this variety. The natural acidity and herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc is softened here with 10 g/L of residual sugar. The wine is round and fruity, with a mix of preserved lemon, white peach and pineapple. Drink slightly chilled.                      ",Croft Vineyard,89,39.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Huett
France,"
                      It's often forgotten that Pinot Blanc is one of the permitted grapes in Champagne. Normally found in the Aube, it makes, as here, a wine softer than Chardonnay, with ripe white fruits and an open texture. This wine is attractive, fruity and ready to drink.

                      Brawny and thick in richness, this wine evolves in the glass and softens, its tannins going from grippy to polished.

                      This pure Pommard clone offering has a lightly leathery scent, and a nice mix of marionberry fruit and baking spices. Though tasters vary as far as likes/dislikes regarding Brett, there's a trailing bitterness here and a sense that this would be best consumed while it's young.

                      This Merlot's herbal berry aromas are tinged with brett and vinegar. It's tannic on the palate, without the body to support that kind of edginess.

                      This wine is rich, packed with red and citrus fruits and with a taut, nervy texture. A recent bottling, it needs to age to bring out the ripe fruits and calm the acidity. Then it will be a full wine, lightly structured and delicious. Drink from 2019.                      ",Blanc de Noirs Brut,91,45.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Pinot Noir,Devaux

                      A touch of crushed fennel seed plays about the lemon-zest nose. The palate bursts open with bright lemon freshness and verve.

                      This wine's sharp tropical fruit, citrus and generic green aromas scream Chilean Sauvignon Blanc.

                      For a white wine, this one has almost the feel of a big red. It shows a deep, gold color, lots of body, a gripping texture and flavors that are much more savory and nutty than simply fruity. It should open up and get more interesting with time.

                      Heady but also very pure notes of ripest Mirabelle leap from the glass. On the palate, their fruit expression becomes even more intense, boosted by the sweetness that swishes across the tongue. A counterpoint of lemon freshness sets an accent of freshness but does not impede the ripeness, expression or flow of the fruit. This is intense, sweet and full-on.

The very lively mousse is fine and creamy while the red-apple notes are joined on the palate by a more leafy, more tart notion of red hedgerow fruit. Think hawthorn and rose hip. This is very dry, but the very fine creaminess of the tiny bubbles and subtle notes of rye sourdough provide ample balance on this elegant wine.

                      With this vintage, the former Charles Blondeau-Danne père domaine is under Piffaut family ownership with a new name. Full of white stone fruits and with a tight citrus texture, the wine is still young. Its acidity and fruitiness are matched by the tight texture and nervy character of a wine that can wait.

                      This is a curious, highly individual Malbec. The nose is briary, with sandalwood notes and a suggestion of blueberry. The palate, however, is severely ripped with acidity, such that this is borderline astringent. Flavors of plum, currant, lemon, spice and leafy herbs finish gritty due to enamel-peeling acidity.                      ",Naoki's Vineyard,87,30.0,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,,Malbec,Casarena

New Zealand,"
                      This is an ultralush wine, harking back to Chardonnay from several decades ago. A buttered popcorn note overwhelms the nose, nearly overpowering the peach and pineapple tones. The palate is rich and opulent, with the oak and malolactic influence sitting heavily on the tongue. Those fans of Chardonnay from the '80s and '90s will find this wine a trip down memory lane.                      ",Small Parcels Wild Grace,85,30.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Chardonnay,Kim Crawford

                      This is the definition of a young ripe bomber with big berry aromas and floral notes. Hardness on the palate makes this a tough hill to conquer now—fierce tannins are unforgiving. Toasty blackberry and coffee flavors are gritty on a long finish with lasting blackness.

                      Definitely falling into the sessionable and chillable reds category, winemaker Karen Steinwachs had fun with this carbonically treated wine, which shows sour red cherry and a touch of smoke on the nose. The lightly bodied palate is not particularly complex, but the tart red-fruit flavors are playful, quaffable and extremely refreshing.

                      From a high-elevation site where the vines enjoy volcanic calcareous soils, this lightly ripe wine is high toned in pomegranate, rhubarb and orange peel, textured with a sense of crushed rock, and easy to love.

Spain,"
                      This wine's ripe black fruit aromas suggest prune and raisin. Rough tannins make for a drying, tough mouthfeel, with desiccated-seeming smoked meat, cassis and raisin flavors.

                      Black cherry, smoke and a hint of caramel make for a very familiar and satisfying nose on this well-priced bottling.

                      Dried berries, fennel pollen and layers of herbal intrigue arise on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah.

                      Floral tones of verbena and jasmine are oddly pronounced on the nose of this wine, dominating the green apple and melon rind fruit. The round mouthfeel shows a bit of flatness on the midpalate, echoed by a final note of citrus oil that lacks some needed verve.

                      This wine tastes fully mature, with aromas like balsamic and cedar, and flavors that are more earthy and leathery than fruity.                      ",Nightshade,84,22.0,California,California,California Other,Red Blends,Naggiar
Spain,"
                      A watermelon-red color and green-leaning aromas of beets and lettuce lead to a heavy palate.

                      Aromas of game, wild herb, mature black-skinned fruit and a whiff of barnyard follow over to the dense, extracted palate along with prune and licorice. It's on the funky, overripe side, with a velvety texture that gives way to a dusty, drying finish. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit flavors and freshness.                      ",Vigna Machia dei Goti,89,46.0,Southern Italy,Taurasi,,Aglianico,Antonio Caggiano

US,"
                      At first whiff this wine has diesel fumes that later settle into less-alarming but strong oak overtones like charred wood and grilled meat. Full body, saturated fruit and spice flavors and moderate tannins fill out its hefty profile.                      ",Shred,83,18.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Red Blends,Entropy Cellars

Spain,"
                      After a couple of good vintages, this wine was clearly affected by 2014's marginal harvest conditions. The nose is gamy and full of olive and damp earth notes. The palate is tannic beyond belief, leading to a scratchy finish. In between, there are dark berry and coffee flavors.

Spain,"
                      Clove, mint and chocolate aromas and flavors dominate this wine, suggesting forced oak. In between all that wood is a cloying mouthfeel marked by weedy sweetness. This might rank as one of the most manipulated and artificial-tasting wines from Spain.                      ",El Chaparral Old Vines,83,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Vega Sindoa
Chile,"
                      Gritty, almost-burnt aromas of rubber and chewing gum make this rosé seem far from clean and fresh. It's creamy and candied in feel, with oxidized melon and papaya flavors that hollow out on the finish.                      ",Natura Organic,83,11.0,Rapel Valley,,,Rosé,Emiliana
Spain,"
                      Sweaty, yeasty aromas lead the nose of this wine. It has a grape skin-like texture and salty, bitter orange peel flavors. On the finish, it's oxidized and cheesy, with almost no fruit.                      ",Coralí,83,12.0,Northern Spain,Empordà,,Rosé,Espelt

The texture is dry and astringent but the fruit component is so focused that it softens the tannic blow somewhat.

Tight and still tart, it mixes wild berry fruit with well-managed herb and bark accents.

This Dijon clone blend was fermented in one quarter new French oak barrels. A portion underwent malolactic fermentation, yielding a well-balanced wine with a steely core of pear and apple fruit.

There are some chalky, mineral notes that quietly add depth to the palate, while ripe grapefruit and lime round out the finish.

                      Condensed red- and black-berry aromas are met with tones of fresh herbs and pepper. The palate shows a good progression of ripe fruit, nuanced by sweet herb and astringent black pepper. The medium-grained tannins linger on the finish with a dusting of cocoa.

                      Syrah (39%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (36%) take the lead on this wine, with the balance Merlot (18%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas bring appeal, with notes of plum, wheat and assorted dried herb. The flavors are plump in feel but still elegant, wanting a bit more tannic structure to fully stand them up.

                      This wine is seductive and delicious yet well balanced, from an aroma of pear tart to substantial but not showy flavors of kiwi, apricot and guava that coat the palate. The texture is generous and mouthfilling but backed by subtle acidity that keeps it lively. Vintner Jeff Morgan is doing great things with Lodi grapes.

                      Tart apple and bright lemon on the nose promise freshness and poise. The rounded palate follows with equally tart freshness and wonderfully fine creamy mousse. It is lively citrus that dominates from the midpalate to the long dry finish and provides just the right amount of briskness and refreshment for a perfect summery apéritif.

                      Never hugely sweet but certainly ripe and honeyed, this wine is impressively rich. Apricot and bitter-orange flavors are balanced by great acidity and a taut lemon-zest texture. Named to celebrate the arrival of thrushes in the spring, the wine is young and will be better from 2019.

There are subtle notes of Bergamot orange and cardamom, with a light toasty touch from having aged in 21% new oak. Delicious already, it should age nicely for up to a decade.

                      From the famed terra rossa soils of Coonawarra, Penfold's Bin 128 is a shining example of both (relatively) cooler climate Shiraz and of the brand's own distinctive style. More broody, complex and dark fruited than many of its regional counterparts, aromas of black cherry, blackberry, dark chocolate, vanilla and mint swirl together. Tight-grained tannins weave through the rich but not overblown flavors of dark fruit and earth. Overall, this feels very approachable now but with the capacity to age for the next seven years or so.                      ",Bin 128 Coonawarra,91,30.0,South Australia,Coonawarra,,Shiraz,Penfolds

                      From 100-year-old vines revived by the Calabria family themselves, this is a broody, robust red that needs time in the cellar. Ripe plum and dark berry, dark chocolate, pepper and plenty of charred oak dominate the nose. The palate dials the richness up another notch, coating the tongue like a wool blanket with more plush fruit and toasty, chewy oak. This is a beast of a wine at the moment and needs a few more years to settle. Drink 2020–2038.

                      A severely oaked nose deals aromas of shoe polish and charred wood. A chunky jammy palate is more flabby than in prime shape. Heavy oak combined with pencil lead and black-fruit flavors precede a finish with front and center oak. All in all, there's too much burnt wood on this blend of Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot.                      ",Private Selection,87,45.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blends,Alpasión

Rounded and dark yet lively in character, flavors of pomegranate, black cherry and black raspberry are framed by zippy acidity and lifted by a pinch of dried herbs.

                      Touches of lime and lemon zest entice on the shy but refreshing nose. The palate adds a mellow ripe-apple note, helped along by a creamy mousse. The long finish is poised and dry.                      ",Brut,91,17.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,,Sparkling Blend,Lucien Albrecht
France,"
                      A touch of stone fruit gives a richer fruitier edge to the apple notes on the nose. The palate is wonderfully fresh but majors on that fresh crisp apple aroma, helped along by lively citrus. The bubbles are fine and consistent on the refreshing, slender and almost creamy body—a wonderful apéritif style with a dry finish.

                      Balsamic aromas of soy sauce, Modena vinegar, black olive and stewed berry fruits form the opening on this clampy Ribera with pinching tannins that narrow the palate. Savory blackberry and boysenberry flavors finish with some heat and hard tannins. Drink through 2035.

US,"
                      The nose on this bottling is extremely shy and reserved at this stage of its life, showing light aromas of damp oak and lanolin. There is decent tension to the sip, where flavors of nectarine, Gravenstein apple and a chalky minerality barely start to show.                      ",Estate,87,32.0,California,Santa Clara Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Sarah's Vineyard

                      This is a big, beefy wine, with tart black currant, sour cherry, herbal notes and charred, savory undertones. Fine-grained tannins and more savory, herbal characters balance rich fruit on the palate. The finish is long, drying and oaky. Drink now–2028.

                      Floral like a rose garden, this wine appears deeply extracted and dark in color, its style intensely full-bodied. Black cherry, rhubarb, blueberry and dark-chocolate flavors make for a taste experience that's both tart and richly concentrated.                      ",Gap's Crown,90,65.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Armida
France,"
                      This small-production, richly concentrated wine has a dense texture and firm tannins. It is full of ripe berries laced with spice from wood aging and with some good aging potential. Drink this fruity, structured wine from 2020.                      ",Vieilles Vignes,90,75.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,,Pinot Noir,Arnaud Baillot
US,"
                      This meaty wine offers a payload of black fruit and even darker seams of espresso and charcoal. The barrels used likely had a pretty heavy toast, as the flavors border on burnt. It's rare a Pinot Noir belongs with barbecue; this one does.                      ",Westbrook Vineyard,90,30.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Pinot Noir,Brandborg
Chile,"
                      This leads with jammy, foxy aromas of cherry candy and milk chocolate. Its woody, spicy flavors seem unnatural, tasting more like drugstore chocolate than fresh fruit.                      ",Reserva,81,15.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Carmenère,Ventisquero
Spain,"
                      A yellow color and astringent aromas of grape skins, petrol and pyrazines set this blend of Airen, Macabeo and Sauvignon Blanc off on the wrong foot. Its stale fruit and yeast flavors seem oxidized.                      ",Fatum,80,13.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,White Blend,Manuel Manzaneque Suárez
Spain,"
                      This wine's salad dressing and mustard aromas signal some volatility. It's jammy and shapeless on the palate, with saucy berry and mustard flavors. It was tasted twice with slightly varying results.                      ",Fincas Valdemacuco Roble,80,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Valdemar
US,"
                      This wine is bewilderingly savory in tones of clove and sage, but then turns juicy and balanced from flavors of strawberry and blackberry. Grainy in complex texture and tannin, it offers a powerful full-bodied richness and wild quality that's undeniably memorable.                      ",Walala Vineyard,98,70.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Three Sticks
US,"
                      This wine is grown in old coastal soils and sand, driven greatly by the ground underneath it and its surrounding Laguna Ridge environment. It has density and energy in equal measure, a balance of weighty apple and pear mixed in toasted oak and freshness.                      ",Vine Hill,98,80.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kistler
US,"
                      Made from a block within the producer's vineyard, which has a different soil series and clonal selection than the rest of the site, this is a stellar, memorable wine that's intensely layered and textured, with lasting, lingering acidity. Bright and inviting in fennel and dried apricot, the broken shale within the soil shows itself in stony, mineral components of oyster shell and white flower, with a fresh yet complex finish. Enjoy 2021–2025                      ",Cuvée Cathleen Kistler Vineyard,98,100.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kistler

                      Aromas of ripe dark berry, cedar and mocha lead the way on this full-bodied Nero d'Avola. The dense palate offers blackberry jam, cocoa and tobacco alongside close-grained tannins that need another year or two to unwind. Drink after 2020.                      ",Don Antonio,90,45.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,Nero d'Avola,Morgante
Austria,"
                      There's a subtle but intriguing note of dried hayflower on the nose of this wine. It also perfumes the palate, where a streak of lifted lemon spells poise and a richer, more sonorous note adds creaminess. Together, these flavors are a synthesis of freshness and mellow pear fruit.                      ",,90,22.0,Carnuntum,,,Chardonnay,Netzl

",Demesse Vecchie,90,23.0,Lombardy,Lugana,,Turbiana,Olivini
Italy,"
                      Delicate, enticing scents of spring wild flower and ripe pear lead the way on this bright refreshing white.

                      This blend of 45% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 10% Barbera is citrus-driven and textured, winning in its light touch and refreshing grasp of acidity.

US,"
                      This sources from multiple appellations, combining grapes into a cohesive unit of deep richness and dusty mineral. The richness takes form in flavours of chocolate-covered-cherries and currants, with accents of graphite and dried herb.                      ",Unfiltered,89,59.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Newton
Spain,"
                      From the opening gun, this is overtly and massively ripe, hence it smells of maple, raisin and prune along with crème de cassis liqueur. A heavyweight from front to back, this tastes of brandied black fruits, chocolate cake, clove and other baking spices. An unctuous finish is the opposite of light and dainty.                      ",1194,89,130.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blends,Perinet
Italy,"
                      Underbrush, pressed rose, truffle and leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this medium-bodied red. The already rather approachable palate offers dried cherry, clove and roasted coffee bean alongside fine-grained but rather drying tannins. Drink after 2020.                      ",Tettimora,89,100.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Scarpa
Austria,"
                      Apart from the fine spray of fizz, this nose might pass as that of fresh fruit juice, so vivid are the notes of Mirabelle plum and yellow apple. The palate is more vinous, with a smooth backdrop of yeast and generous dosage. This is easy, dry and fruit driven, but very fresh.                      ",Jahrgang Brut Klassik,89,25.0,Österreichischer Sekt,,,Sparkling Blend,Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei

                      Aromas of barrel spice, baking spice and earthy plum form an inviting nose. This is chewy and full on the palate, with good balance.

",Crianza,89,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
Austria,"
                      A shy nose gives off just a little carbon dioxide from the fizz. The substantial palate, however, shows lots of yeasty roundness. This is mild but full bodied and leaves a long impression of lees and grapy freshness. Just a little pepper tingles on the finish of this Grüner Veltliner-based Sekt.                      ",,89,32.0,Österreichischer Sekt,,,Grüner Veltliner,Steininger

                      Bready lightly oxidized aromas and a gold color are not overly encouraging. A mostly lifeless palate is pickled and tastes of brined citrus fruits, while a dry hollow finish is the ending.

Spain,"
                      Grassy berry aromas and oaky clove scents are unconvincing. This blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha feels wiry and a bit like vinegar. Blatant oak and tart plum flavors finish with a distinctly strong note of clove.                      ",Calendas,83,17.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Ochoa
Spain,"
                      A tan color along with severely oxidized aromas make one guarded as sweaty notes of apple juice and cider roll out. A foamy amorphous palate is not a plus, while this organic varietal Xarello tastes of dried peach and apricot in front of a finish with can't-miss notes of nuts and popcorn. For a Cava leader such as Alta Alella, this overpriced organic bottling is weak.                      ",Capsigrany Organic,83,44.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Alta Alella
Argentina,"
                      Minty clover and raw red-berry and plum aromas announce a wine that's less than ripe. That impression is confirmed on a rough and scratchy palate. Sour plum and currant flavors finish crisp and grating.                      ",Estate,83,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Malbec,Alta Vista
France,"
                      Surprisingly dense and dark scents of licorice and medicinal black cherry set the stage on the nose of this wine, with a subtle warmth as well.

Portugal,"
                      This is a soft wine, surprisingly so considering the grape and its origins in northern Vinho Verde. It has fruit but it does seem to miss out on flavor and definition.                      ",Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Maria Papoila,83,18.0,Vinho Verde,,,Alvarinho,Wines & Winemakers

                      Named for the falcons that nest above this single block, this bottling offers aromas of cooked cherry, dried herbs, nutmeg and charred oak. The palate is wrapped in clove spice and dried red fruit, with a persistent tension and overall earthy flavor profile.                      ",Dominio del Falcon,92,88.0,California,Sta.

                      From a vineyard planted by winery in 1997 that overlooks the Santa Ynez River, this bottling shows clean black-cherry, vanilla, clove and star anise aromas. There is a strong red-plum and orange-rind tang on the palate, which is framed by strong acidity and a chalky texture. Potpourri and black cherry pop on the finish.                      ",Vista Al Rio,92,88.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sanford
US,"
                      This is an unusual commingling of old-vine Petite Sirah from the Napa Valley and Tempranillo from Luc's Vineyard in Sonoma County, a 50-50 partnership between the two. Made in a carbonic style in stainless steel, it tastes of fresh strawberry, raspberry, with a fresh floral aspect to the palate that's juicy, plush and bursting with energy.

                      Complexity and concentration mark this wine as a standout. It has a deep, dark color, with aromas of black cherry, currant and mint. Layered flavors of ripe fruit and mild spice are bolstered by a velvety texture of fine-grained tannins. The finish lingers nicely, and the wine will surely improve in the cellar.

                      This wine is extremely deep, complex and concentrated in flavor while maintaining wonderful finesse in texture. It starts with fragrant aromas of freshly baked bread and cinnamon. Those are followed by a creamy mouthfeel, pinpoint bubbles and subtle peach, white cherry and apricot flavors that are both delicate and focused at the same time, leading to a long finish. It is so tempting now but best after 2020.                      ",L'Ermitage Brut Rosé,96,75.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino County,Sparkling Blend,Roederer Estate

The palate is similarly thick and chewy, but with elegance and balance, showing black cherry, blueberry, white pepper and crushed rocks, leveled by a steadily rising acidity.

US,"
                      Reduced on the nose in welcoming, complex ways, this white is intensely spiced and earthy, evolving into a light balanced take on caramel apple, pear and shavings of lemon zest. From a cool windy site in the Sebastopol Hills section of the larger appellation, the lemon takes on a candied note that boosts the acidity to fresh high-toned heights.

                      The nose on this twist-top bottling is a bit reductive at first, with a touch of petrol, citrus pith and Anjou pear rinds.

It starts rich and robust in juicy salty concentration before allowing in a streak of bright floral acidity that gives it freshness and life. White flower and salty stone persist on the palate.                      ",Kistler Vineyard,96,90.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Kistler

                      This is comprised of fruit from two coastal sites, but it does not hold back on flavor or complexity.

                      The nose only gives hints of lemon freshness. The palate adds ripe pear notes, boosted by a dollop of residual sweetness, to the lemon freshness.

France,"
                      The standard nonvintage from this producer benefits from its policy of blending in a high percentage of older reserve wines. That gives the wine its richness and smooth, ripe character. Hints of apples are still there along with a good balance between acidity and toastiness. Drink now.

Australia,"
                      This wine offers melon, lemon and fig tones that are bright and ripe without being jammy. A toasted coconut-oak note serves to support rather than overpower, and the lees work adds just enough texture and complexity to compliment a tight, grainy texture.

                      Herbal, smoky berry aromas taken as a whole smell much like a burning field. On the palate, this is clamping and short.

                      Stony citrus aromas are as good as it gets. A highly citric, foamy palate lacks refinement and charm, while this tastes of underripe pineapple and lime.                      ",Edoné Cuvée de María,82,20.0,Spain Other,Spain,,Sparkling Blend,Viñedos Balmoral

                      A rusty color and odd aromas of clove and cardamom are unconvincing. A wide palate lacks focus and punch, while this tastes of Middle Eastern spices but not much, if any, fruit.

                      This wine's delicate scents reminiscent of wild flowers and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The rounded, straightforward palate offers white peach, yellow pear and light bitter almond notes.

                      This light-salmon-colored wine was made from the unusual combination of Grenache and Nebbiolo grapes. It is light bodied but has substantive qualities like an earthy raspberry aroma and a smooth texture that spreads canteloupe and cinnamon over the palate.

                      Being 100% varietal, baking spice, dried savory herb, dried tobacco and cherry aromas are followed by plump lighter-styled fruit flavors, with red-fruit and black-tea notes on the finish. The tannic structure is surprisingly light for the variety.                      ",Estate,87,45.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tertulia
US,"
                      Aromas of licorice, brandied cherry, red currant and black pepper show on a nose. This is a solid Cabernet Franc, if slightly over oaked, with juicy flavors of cranberry and pomegranate upfront leading to nutmeg, toasted oak and more black pepper. Tangy, lifting acidity keeps it in balance, with dusty tannins lingering through the oaky finish of muddled cherries and more spice.

                      With its complex nose melding whiffs of fresh raspberry and violet with savory spice, smoke and nut tones, it's hard not to be mesmerized by this wine's bouquet alone. The palate is pure and lavish, boasting pristine blackberry and mulberry flavors held taut by a firm tannic backbone. It's remarkably integrated and supple now but should improve through 2035 and hold substantially further.

                      This combines grapes from the Martinelli family's Charles Ranch Vineyard in Fort Ross-Seaview with grapes from Platt Vineyard, a site long sourced by Ramey overlooking the Pacific Ocean near Freestone—the producer's coolest site. It melds exotic ginger with apple skin, melon rind and bright focused acidity that remains fresh, succulent and lingering.

                      This single-vineyard wine comes from a parcel that sits at 1,300 feet facing the Mediterranean sea. Its dark color, fabulous ripe fruits and perfumed character give it both richness and longevity. With 95% Mourvèdre, it has all the structure, dark tannins and spice of this grape that is at its best in this appellation. Drink this wine from 2023.

                      There's extreme, maybe even obscene, amounts of cracked black pepper on the savory nose of this cool-climate expression, which comes from the same 12 rows each vintage. There are also scents of roasted beef, asphalt and a pinch of lavender. The pepper character coats the palate too, diced by lively acidity. This is, perhaps, the most pitch-perfect show of Côte-Rôtie in California to date.                      ",Turner Vineyard,95,46.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Syrah,Samsara

                      From the winery's coastal estate property, this is inviting in candied strawberry Jolly Rancher and peach.

                      Three cheers for this much-improved release from the Russell-Grooters estate vineyard. Refined and complex, it deftly mixes cherry and citrus flavors.

This wine attacks the palate with metallic flavors of copper pennies, hickory and extremely underripe cranberry. Sharp and lacking in structue, dusty tannins make an appearance on the finish attempting to reign in the matallic and tart berry notes, but are ultimately outmatched.

A plump, chunky palate lacks definition, while this tastes of generic berry fruits and green herbs. Green notes linger on an underwhelming finish; this is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Malbec, hence the Quatro (four) name.

On the palate, delightful flavors of ripe red cherry, cranberry, granite and crushed thyme are supported by barely perceptible tannins and a peppery spice. There is a charming vein of acidity right from the start that weaves all the way through the wild black raspberry and white pepper-inflected finish. Drink now–2025.

                      An earthy mineral aroma leads to baking-spice flavors, mild cherry and subtle plum fruit in this very smooth-textured and medium- to full-bodied wine.

A smooth tannic structure provides a backdrop for ripe fruit and spice flavors that coalesce in a long, pleasant finish.

                      This blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 39% Malbec and 21% Cabernet Sauvignon needs a little time to unwind, but is quite compelling when given that space. Aromas of oregano, dried berries, leather and earth lead into a palate of dark red fruits, juniper and pine wood. Potpourri spice and more voluptuous purple-flower and fruit flavors emerge with time.

Lighter bodied than expected on the palate, the bottling offers strawberry, cherry tomato, peppercorn and oregano flavors, and is still quite young.

                      Sorry folks, but this smells like vegetables in the garbage can, meaning earthy and rotten.

Elegantly structured, the polished, full-bodied palate delivers succulent Morello cherry and raspberry compote, while licorice, tobacco and vanilla accents add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with fresh acidity. Without a doubt, this is one of the best 2014 Barolos out there. Drink 2022–2034.

                      This is a fairly typical Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc nose, veering more down the citrus and green vegetal lane than the tropical one. Notes of grapefruit, nettles, lime, green bell pepper and ground white pepper are slightly overpowered on the palate by searing acidity that's only barely balanced by some textural roundness.

It is still young and powerful while never losing its elegance. The black fruits are still strongly dominated by the tannins, but that will change. The wood aging and the rich berry flavors will let the wine age. Drink from 2021.                      ",Vinha da Coroa,95,80.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado

                      This is a medium pink-hued rosé exhibiting ripe red strawberry and red cherry characters. The palate shows a little residual sugar and plenty of ripe berry fruit. There's just enough acidity to keep this from going into candied territory.

                      There's an extreme and awesome amount of black pepper and crushed asphalt alongside a bit of elderberry fruit, on the savory nose of this bottling from a biodynamic, quite coastal vineyard. That savory cracked peppercorn aspect invades the palate as well, but also picks up more rounded blackberry and purple-flower flavors, set against a lively acidity and versatile texture that will play well with a variety of foods.

Aromas of blackberry paste, fresh lilacs and hoisin sauce drop into a palate where blueberry and baked black-plum flavors are decorated with cola, sarsaparilla and black-pepper spices.

                      This wine is especially lively and focused, driven by electric acidity, nervy tannins and intricate fruit and spice flavors. While full bodied, it's not a blockbuster yet gives plenty of excitement in terms of mint, red-cherry and cinnamon flavors and a bracing mouthfeel. It will no doubt age well for several years.

",Le Fil d'Ariane,87,20.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,,Rosé,Domaine des Peirecèdes
Georgia,"
                      This wine offers aromas of black plum and smoke. Flavors of black cherry, bacon and oregano are joined by a vein of cranberry just prior to the long finish. While the tannins feel a bit grippy at first sip, a sense of brightness prevails across the entire palate.                      ",,91,45.0,Kakheti,,,Saperavi,Lukasi
Spain,"
                      This leads with wiry, bouyant black fruit aromas. The palate is jammy and full bodied but also raging with bold acidity. After an initial burst of plum, cassis and subtle herb flavors, darker notes of toast and chocolate settle in on the finish.                      ",Soul Limited Edition Old Vines,91,45.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Crápula
US,"
                      Coming from old vines, this bottling is typically one of the more compelling non-Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County. This vintage shows light lemon, chalk, white peach and Asian pear on the nose. The palate is grippy as ever, with lemon-lime acidity and a green-pear flavor.                      ",Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Old Vines,91,26.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Chenin Blanc,Foxen
US,"
                      There's less of this wine available than in past years, but the quality remains high. Its nuanced aromas include cocoa dust, caramel and red fruit. Berry and cherry flavors come into focus as it opens, and it seems likely to benefit from more bottle age.                      ",Elizabeth's Reserve,91,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim

Italy,"
                      Orchard fruit and citrusy aromas mingle in the glass together with a yeasty whiff of bread dough. On the palate, bright acidity lifts white peach, ripe apple and a toasted almond note alongside a soft, persistent mousse.                      ",Riserva Perlé Brut,91,40.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,,Chardonnay,Ferrari
US,"
                      This Super Tuscan-style blend, which includes 75% Merlot from two vineyards and 25% Sangiovese from a third, offers aromas of plum skin, baking spice and crushed asphalt on the nose. There is a strong earthy and rocky flavor to the palate, which is very dry and lifted by solid acidity.                      ",Gemellaia,91,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Red Blends,Giornata
New Zealand,"
                      This wine erupts with ripe mango, pineapple and grapefruit, backed by some grass and nettle notes. There's fruit weight on the palate, threaded with wet stone and bright acidity, with a long, slightly savory, green-herbed finish.

US,"
                      Big, brawny waves of blackberry and mocha dot the landscape of this full-bodied wine that's tense in structure and thick in rich tannins. An earthy note of forest floor complements the bold fruit and gives depth to the wine.                      ",Reserve Century Vines,91,60.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Zinfandel,Kunde
Spain,"
                      Leathery berry and animal aromas blend nicely into savory plum and berry scents to form a good nose. A tight, drawn-in palate is a bit hard, although there's no complaints with this Rioja's energy level. Saucy, slightly salty tomato and red plum flavors finish with earthy notes. This is a classic Rioja in every sense; drink through 2025.                      ",Tradición H,91,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,La Gitana

                      This wine has almost enough color and flavor to be called a red. It shows a deep pink or light ruby color, aromas like rose petals and flavors like black cherry and pomegranate seeds. It's unusual, vivid and fun for adventurous drinkers.

France,"
                      Ripe kiwi and tropical fruits come from this luscious Picard family wine. It offers acidity and freshness, but opulence dominates at this stage in the wine's development. The wine has good potential, with acidity, wood-aging flavors and spice at the end. Drink from 2022.                      ",La Maltroie Premier Cru,94,80.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Au Pied du Mont Chauve
Portugal,"
                      Foot treading in open lagars, followed by wood aging, has conferred on this wine an open richness, bold fruits and great ripeness. At the same time, it is balanced, packed with dark plum and damson flavors and an impressive structure. The wine will age longer, so don't drink before 2021.                      ",Sagrado Tinto Reserva,94,23.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Sagrado

                      Another truly exceptional Chardonnay from Maison Jadot's Oregon project, this explosively aromatic wine offers a seamless mash-up of citrus, tree fruits and lemon verbena.

",Hyland Vineyard,94,58.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Résonance
US,"
                      Tightly woven on the nose, this single-vineyard expression shows aromas of Meyer lemon pith, tangerine spray, lime zest and almond cream. The palate is fresh and zesty in lime and grapefruit flavors, but a backdrop of smooth nut butter and poached nectarine brings it all together.                      ",Soberanes Vineyard,94,45.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Roar
US,"
                      Baked cranberry, cherry, clove, vanilla bean and mossy earth show on the nose of this always much anticipated bottling from the region's first cult producer. The palate is tangy with rounded black-plum, star anise and black-peppercorn flavors. It's excellent now, but those tart elements will find more integration with patience. Drink 2019–2035.                      ",Ten,94,82.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke

Chile,"
                      Rubbery berry fruit aromas include notes of latex and scrambled eggs. The palate is a bit thick and lacking in snap, while this everyday Pinot Noir tastes of lightly spiced plum and berries. A simple finish with low acidity closes this out.                      ",Reserva,84,10.0,Leyda Valley,,,Pinot Noir,MontGras
France,"
                      Tropical-fruit flavors with mango and pineapple in evidence make for a full wine. It is rich and rounded, with the fruit merging into over-ripeness. Drink now.                      ",Le Chemin Blanc,84,,Burgundy,Mâcon-Igé,,Chardonnay,Nicolas Maillet
Chile,"
                      Gaseous aromas blend with jammy berry fruit and baking spice scents on a nose that lacks elegance. This is quite heavy and blocky on the palate, with oversize tannins. Thick, dense blackberry flavors roll out on a tannic finish with no give. This comes from a poor vintage for red wines.                      ",Orzada Made With Organic Grapes,84,21.0,Maipo Valley,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Odfjell
New Zealand,"
                      There's bit of a rubbery cabbage quality to this wine that's overwhelming the fruit characters. When you do find the lemon and pineapple notes, they're lacking some freshness and come with a lot of acidity on the palate. Overall, the disjointed nature of this wine is hard to shake.                      ",,84,13.0,Marlborough,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Pikorua

US,"
                      This is made from 100% Pinot Noir grapes grown on the producer's Olivet Grange Vineyard—a fun, quaffing wine with plenty of quality to back up its whimsy. Light-orange-yellow in color, it's funky and earthy in flavors of wild strawberry, wet stone and dried herb.                      ",Whole Buncha Bubbles Blanc de Noir,91,68.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,Inman Family
US,"
                      Thick and rich in feel but with fresh acidity, this wine tastes of lemon, strawberry and a touch of grapefruit. It is layered and complex while offering approachable rewards, made from a majority of Pinot Noir with smaller amounts of Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier.                      ",Brut Rosé,91,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery

US,"
                      This white has a creamy, lush texture that is complemented by a bright enduring freshness of grapefruit and lime.

US,"
                      Light and pleasant aromas of nectarine and red apple show on the nose of this single-vineyard expression of rosé.

Reflecting the nose, the savory palate is loaded with personality, delivering crushed raspberry, black cherry, clove, aromatic herb and a distinct but intriguing gamy note alongside a backbone of assertive, fine-grained tannins. Vibrant acidity lends balance. Open this way in advance to give it time to breathe. Drink 2023–2038.

France,"
                      The flinty soil of this vineyard has given a wine that is intense, steely and mineral in texture. Crisp citrus and gooseberry flavors are enmeshed in this spicy and taut wine.

US,"
                      Lemon blossoms, crushed chalk, sea salt, sandalwood smoke and lime pith swirl together into an extremely inviting, compelling and truly Burgundian nose on this bottling by Dave Potter. The palate is grippy and layered with texture and flavors of lemon rind, crushed nuts, judicious oak and the slightest pop of crème brûlée on the finish. Drink now–2030.

US,"
                      Very tightly wound on the nose, this impressive bottling by Matt Dees of Jonata fame starts with fresh and seabreeze-like aromas, from lime zest and pink lemonade to wet slate and cool steel. The sip is energetic and racy like a classic Chablis, showing lemon balm, honeysuckle and well integrated oak across a texturally compelling platform.

Full bodied and tightly wound, the palate delivers Marasca cherry, pomegranate, licorice and orange zest framed in taut fine-grained tannins. Give this several more years to come around then drink or hold for even more complexity. Drink from 2022 through 2032.

                      Fragrant blue flower, wild berry and baking spice aromas meld with a whiff of dried aromatic herb. Smooth and savory, the elegant palate shows raspberry preserve, juicy black cherry, licorice and espresso framed by fine-grained tannins. A hint of chopped mint backs up the lingering finish.

France,"
                      From the chalk plateau high above the River Lot, this well-textured wine is packed with fruit and minerality. Its structure is dense, lifted by acidity and softened from wood aging. Still young, it will be better from 2020.

France,"
                      Now becoming mature, this wine, part of a joint venture between Bertrand Vigouroux of Cahors and Sonoma winemaker/consultant Paul Hobbs, is showing dusty tannins, a tarry rich smoky character and considerable wood-aging flavors. It is perhaps less sophisticated than later vintages from this producer, boasting of the power of Cahors rather than its elegance. Drink from 2019.                      ",Crocus Prestige,90,45.0,Southwest France,Cahors,,Malbec,Paul Hobbs & Bertrand Gabriel Vigouroux

                      This bottling of an Alban clone was fermented 56% whole cluster, and makes for a more mineral-driven Grenache, with aromas of dried red currants, sarsaparilla, leather and pencil shavings. It's very dry on the palate with red plum, rosewater, candied jasmine and a hint of spearmint, but the firm tannins need much more time to smooth out.

                      What a difference a year makes. Where the 2013 vintage of this wine is still gargantuan, this vintage—although certainly not lacking in power and richness—offers up much more than ripe fruit and oak. The red fruit is lifted and there's an autumnal feel about this wine: smoke, bramble bushes and dried leaves along with earthy beet-root and sanguine notes. It's still tightly wound, tannic and tangy but for all its brawn, there's grace there too. Drink now–2028 and likely well beyond.

                      Slightly muddied notes of pear appear on the nose. On the dry light palate it is lemon that takes over and adds welcome verve and liveliness. Very refreshing and easy with a dry finish.                      ",Wimmer,87,13.0,Niederösterreich,,,Grüner Veltliner,Hugl-Wimmer

                      A mere whiff of tender lemon freshness appears on the nose. The slender easy palate also benefits from that lemon freshness on its dry finish.                      ",Skeleton,87,10.0,Burgenland,,,Grüner Veltliner,Adolf & Heinrich Fuchs
US,"
                      Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 66% of this wine, with the balance 23% Merlot along with smidgens of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. The aromas bring notes of roasted green pepper, raspberry, clove and cherry, leaning into the green. The dry lighter-styled palate shows more of the same, along with a quite smoky finish.

Argentina,"
                      The combination of exotic spice, blueberry and desert herb aromas this shows is unique to this wine and vineyard. In the mouth, this is rubbery and raw, with scraping tannins.

                      The California producer ventures into Oregon with this excellent single vineyard offering. It's both elegant and full-flavored, with fleshy black fruit and citrus peel highlights.

                      This reserve-level Pinot Noir is aromatic and inviting, with crushed rose and sandalwood scents. Red fruit abounds, recalling cranberry, raspberry and cherry.

                      Spicy whiffs of caramelized honey and saffron lend an earthen tone to ripe but muted yellow peach and apricot here.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Rideau
US,"
                      This appellation blend is better than the winery's single-vineyard expressions, at least right now.

                      Primary, profoundly ripe cherry and raspberry flavors are plush and easy on the palate of this full-bodied blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. Beyond just fruity, however, it's herbal and earthen, too, and balanced by sweet-tart hits of wild strawberry acidity. Ready to drink now but should develop nicely through 2026.

                      An equal split between the two varieties, this brings lurking dark roasted coffee, herb, plum, dark fruit and spice aromas. Its blue fruit flavors are tightly wound; they dip in the middle before coming back together, surrounded by luxurious French oak spice notes. The wood seems a bit primary at present, but there are a lot of good things going on.

US,"
                      This block is home to a mysterious clone of Sauvignon Blanc that appears to be the only one of its kind in the region and thought to hail originally from Northern Italy.

                      Earthy berry aromas are baked and a bit raisiny. On the palate, this is compacted.

                      Stale fruit aromas and a flat palate extinguish hopes of this being anything more than basic Cava.
