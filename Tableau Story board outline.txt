1. What is our data, what we are trying to achieve and what the data looks like
2. Initial data that we graph out, which shows the giant skew
   1. Show the while statistical graphing and is the unabridged version
3. Show the work Janine did
   1. Has the new data that excludes the top 1% (the wines that are stupidly expensive)
   2. Display the graphs, describe what is going on
   3. Show how our ML
      1. What the outcome is
      2. How accurate is our ML
   4. We can show how it works in various countries
4. Show the finalized graphs that show the normalized bell curve
   1. What is the % quartile that we will use to normalize the graph?
   2. Graph the new bell curve and run it through our ML

Outline description of Tableau storyboard

* In our Tableau storyboard, we will be analyzing our data set by comparing the different data points against each other. 
On the first half of the story board, we are looking at how the averages of both points and prices vary across the world by country as well as by region. 
For this information, we are looking to understand what is the production levels of the wine, what the cost on average (per country and region), as well as what are the general price points are per region. Diving in deeper with it, we are then able to cross analyze the points to price ratios per each region/country's wine production.
* In the second half of the Tableau story, we are diving into the information for what the top 5 wines produced were. We were able to identify which region produced the best wine, most cost effective wine, as well as the worst value.
